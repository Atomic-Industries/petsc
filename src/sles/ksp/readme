     KSPIntro - This is the introductory manual page for the Krylov 
space package The Krylov space  package consists of lower level
routines which implement various iterative accelerators for the solution
of linear systems. For a simple interface, see the SLES directory.

Description:
    It includes support for Richardson, Conjugate Gradient, Chebychev,
GMRES, a transpose free QMR, etc.

    The routines are intended to be data structure independent. That is 
the routines should work as written without change on serial and parallel
machines independent of how the vectors, matrices, etc. are stored.

    The vector independence is achieved by using the Vec vector package
for all the vector operations, the user must proved routines which 
perform the matrix multiplies and preconditioner. Particular
implementations of those are availible in other parts of this package,
including the solvers directory, but the KSP* routines are intended
just for the accelerators, not the preconditioners.

   To provide complete flexibility, the KSP* routines use a context
variable. The Krylov space context, KSP.
