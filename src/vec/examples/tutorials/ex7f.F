!  This routine demonstates how a computational module may be written
!  in Fortran and called from a C routine, passing down PETSc objects.

       Scalar           two
       Vec              vec
       MPI_Comm         comm
       integer          ierr,rank

       two  = 2.0

!
!     The Objects vec,comm created in a C routine are now
!     used in fortran routines.
!       
       call VecSet(two,vec,ierr)
       call MPI_Comm_rank(comm,rank,ierr)

!
!  Now call C routine from Fortran, passing in the vector, communicator
!
       call ex7c(vec,comm)
!
!     IO from the fortran routines may cause all kinds of
!     grief while linking. FC_LIBS in base.site is supporsed
!     to take care of it.
