# Checks for compliance with 
# Rule: 'All PETSc function bodies are indented two blanks. Each additional level of loops, if-statements, etc. is indented two more characters. (Reports lines starting with an odd number of blanks, ignoring comments)'

# Steps:
# - Traverse all files in src/
# - exclude src/docs/ holding the documentation only as well as automatic Fortran stuff
# - Strip off comments using GCC
# - find lines starting with an odd number of blanks (this is an obvious violation to the two-blanks-per-level-of-indentation rule)
