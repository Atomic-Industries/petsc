   This provides a simplified interface to the DA distributed
array object in PETSc. This is intended for people who are
NOT using PETSc vectors or objects but just want to distribute
simple rectangular arrays amoung a number of procesors and have
PETSc handle moving the ghost-values when needed.

  In certain applications this can serve as a replacement for 
BlockComm (which is apparently being phased out).

  Usage: 

    SDACreate2d(MPI_Comm,int m,int n,int M,int N,int dof, int stencil_width,
