   This directory will contain various PETSc user contributed matrices
that users found useful. Often they are not well optimized and may contain 
bugs. If after testing, one of these suits your uses in terms of convergence
feel free to further optimize the code and send it back to use for future
inclusion or let us know and we may be able to optimize it for better
performance.
