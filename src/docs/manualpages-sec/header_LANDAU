<H2> LANDAU</H2>

The Landau form of the Fokker-Planck collision operator is the gold standard for small angle collision dominated plasmas, is fully conservative and admits fully conservative finite element discretizations [Hirvijoki and Adams, PoP, 24(3):032121, 2017].
The LANDAU class implements an AMR discretization of the Fokker-Planck collision operator in Landau form using DMPlex and DMForest, within TS function and Jacobian methods.
This class has a constructor that creates an AMR mesh in velocity space in 2.5D (2D axisymetric grid) and fully 3D that is parameterized to create meshes oriented to resolving Maxwellian distributions as well as fast electrons.
A separate method is required to create an internal mass matrix.
This will instantiate two internal functions for use as residual and Jacobian operators in a TS simulation.
