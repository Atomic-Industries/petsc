PETSc |version| Documentation
=============================

.. Important::

  The PETSc docs are currently in transition,
  and different pieces "live" in two different places. In addition to on this page,
  much of the documentation is found `here <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/index.html>`__.

Highly recommended resource: Ed Bueler, `PETSc for Partial Differential Equations: Numerical Solutions in C and Python <https://my.siam.org/Store/Product/viewproduct/?ProductId=32850137>`__ or as a `Google Play E-book <https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Ed_Bueler_PETSc_for_Partial_Differential_Equations?id=tgMHEAAAQBAJ>`__.
