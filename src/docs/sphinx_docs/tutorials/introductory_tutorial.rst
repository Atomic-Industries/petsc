These tutorials are intended for people new to PETSc, who would like to get oriented
by walking through how to use PETSc to perform some fundamental operations.

=============
These tutorials are not intended to cover all possible topics, but rather
to provide a gateway to the rest of the documentation.

In particular, see the :doc:`../../guides/guide_to_examples` which highlights some of the
large number of tutorial examples included with PETSc.
