Creating a 3-dimensional structured regular mesh of 2x2x2 in memory and creating a DM object.
Generate the MOAB mesh hierarchy with 2 levels.
Level 0
DM Object: Coarse Mesh 2 MPI processes
  type: moab
  Coarse Mesh in 3 dimensions:
    Sizes: cells=27, vertices=8, blocks=1
    Boundary trace:
      cells=8, faces=12, vertices=17
    Fields: 1 components
      [0] - DEFAULT
Level 1
DM Object: 2 MPI processes
  type: moab
  DM_0x84000004_0 in 3 dimensions:
    Sizes: cells=125, vertices=64, blocks=1
    Boundary trace:
      cells=40, faces=48, vertices=57
    Fields: 1 components
      [0] - DEFAULT
Level 2
DM Object: 2 MPI processes
  type: moab
  DM_0x84000004_1 in 3 dimensions:
    Sizes: cells=729, vertices=512, blocks=1
    Boundary trace:
      cells=176, faces=192, vertices=209
    Fields: 1 components
      [0] - DEFAULT
