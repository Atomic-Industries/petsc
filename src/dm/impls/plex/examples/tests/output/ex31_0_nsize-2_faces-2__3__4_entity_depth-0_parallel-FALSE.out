Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 0 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 14
Using METIS to partition graph.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 0 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 24, Avg: 30, Max: 36, Balance: 1.200000
Rebalanced.  Min: 30, Avg: 30, Max: 30, Balance: 1.000000
After.       Min: 30, Avg: 30, Max: 30, Balance: 1.000000
