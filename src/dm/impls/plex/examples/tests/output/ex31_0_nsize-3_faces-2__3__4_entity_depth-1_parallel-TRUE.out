Attempt rebalancing of shared points of depth 1 on interface of mesh distribution.
Size of generated auxiliary graph: 35
Using ParMETIS to partition graph.
Comparing number of owned entities of depth 1 on each process before rebalancing, after rebalancing, and after consistency checks.
Initial.     Min: 37, Avg: 44, Max: 54, Balance: 1.218045
Rebalanced.  Min: 43, Avg: 44, Max: 45, Balance: 1.015038
After.       Min: 43, Avg: 44, Max: 45, Balance: 1.015038
