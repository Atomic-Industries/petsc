Testing hand-coded gradient (hc) against finite difference gradient (fd), if the ratio ||fd - hc|| / ||hc|| is
0 (1.e-8), the hand-coded gradient is probably correct.
Run with -tao_fd_test_display to show difference
between hand-coded and finite difference gradient.
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 2.80874e-05, difference ||fd-hc|| = 5.9089e-06
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 5.77365e-06, difference ||fd-hc|| = 5.23778e-06
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 5.77014e-06, difference ||fd-hc|| = 5.23459e-06
Testing hand-coded Hessian (hc) against finite difference Hessian (fd). If the ratio is
O (1.e-8), the hand-coded Hessian is probably correct.
Run with -tao_fd_test_display to show difference
of hand-coded and finite difference Hessian.
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 5.56466e-09, difference ||fd-hc|| = 6.64222e-08
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 5.56466e-09, difference ||fd-hc|| = 6.64222e-08
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 5.56466e-09, difference ||fd-hc|| = 6.64222e-08
