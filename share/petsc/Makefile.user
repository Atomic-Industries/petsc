# -*- mode: makefile -*-

# This sample (GNU) Makefile can be used to compile PETSc applications with a single
# source file and can be easily modified to compile multi-file applications.
# It relies on pkg_config tool, and PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH variables.
# Copy this file to your source directory as "Makefile" and modify as needed.
#
# For example - a single source file can be compiled with:
#
#  $ cd src/snes/tutorials/
#  $ make -f $PETSC_DIR/share/petsc/Makefile.user ex17
#
# The following variable must either be a path to PETSc.pc or just "PETSc" if PETSc.pc
# has been installed to a system location or can be found in PKG_CONFIG_PATH.
PETSc.pc := $(PETSC_DIR)/$(PETSC_ARCH)/lib/pkgconfig/PETSc.pc

# Additional libraries that support pkg-config can be added to the list of PACKAGES below.
PACKAGES := $(PETSc.pc)

# Uncomment the following line for static builds of PETSc
# STATIC = --static
