#  FC_LIB contains the libraries for a CLINKER to use for code containing
#  FORTRAN code (such as I/O or special Fortran runtimes).  
#  The extra -lm is needed to force the C version of libm.a to 
#  be searched before the Fortran 77 version.

# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  These libraries are available via Netlib,
# or see $(PETSC_DIR)/readme for information on retrieving a subset.
