#  This file contains site-specific information.  The definitions below
#  should be changed to match the locations of libraries at your site.
#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
#  FC_LIB contains the libraries for a CLINKER to use for code containing
#  FORTRAN code (such as I/O or special Fortran runtimes).  
#  The extra -lm is needed to force the C version of libm.a to 
#  be searched before the Fortran 77 version.

# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  These libraries are available via Netlib,
# or see $(PETSC_DIR)/readme for information on retrieving a subset.
