#  Generates a shared library from any .a library; not just the PETSc ones
#  This is to allow any user to generate his or her own shared library
#
#  The ${C_SYS_LIB} -lC is too tell the linker the location of the libC.a 
#  library and force it to include those symbols into the shared library.
#  Since there is no .so version of the libC.a it must be done this way.
