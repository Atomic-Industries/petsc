#  This file contains site-specific information.  The definitions below
#  should be changed to match the locations of libraries at your site.
#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# FC_LIB contains the libraries for a CLINKER to use for code containing
# FORTRAN code (such as I/O or special Fortran runtimes).  
#
#  The line -bI:/usr/lpp/xlf/lib/lowsys.exp is probably not needed 
#  when running with OS version 4.1
#
#  Note that when using gcc/g++ is is ESSENTIAL that "-lbsd -lc"
#  precede the Fortran libraries here.  Otherwise, the Fortran
#  routines (such as getenv()), which have the same names on rs6000 
#  machines as the UNIX routines that we really want, will be linked
#  instead and cause mysterious seg violations.
#
#      FC_LIB         = -lbsd -lc /usr/lib/libxlf.a /usr/lib/libxlfutil.a \
#			-Wl,-bI:/usr/lpp/xlf/lib/lowsys.exp
#
FC_LIB         = /usr/lib/libxlf.a /usr/lib/libxlf90.a 
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  These libraries are available via Netlib,
# or see $(PETSC_DIR)/docs/instllation.html for information on retrieving them.
#
# Important: If you use the IBM version of lapack you must include 
#  -lessl at the end of the line defining the BLAS libraries.
#
#  If you list -lessl or -lesslp2 below you must have -DHAVE_ESSL listed in the 
# PCONF line at the bottom of this file.
