#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  See ${PETSC_DIR}/docs/installation.html
# for information on retrieving them.
# If you are lucky, you may have the DEC Alpha math library installed on 
# your machine. The library name is dxml as indicated below, it contains
