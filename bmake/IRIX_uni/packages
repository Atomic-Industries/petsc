#  This file contains site-specific information.  The definitions below
#  should be changed to match the locations of libraries at your site.
#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  See ${PETSC_DIR}/docs/installation.html
# for information on retrieving them
#
# BLAS usually comes with SGI and can be accessed with -lblas listed 
# below for BLAS_LIB. However, the complex BLAS routine izamax() has
# a bug in it, so if you are using complex numbers we recommend using
# the SGI BLAS with extreme care.

# Location of X-windows software

X11_LIB        = -lX11

# Optional location of BlockSolve (MPI version), if you do not have
# BlockSolve, then remove -DPETSC_HAVE_BLOCKSOLVE from the PCONF definition
# below if it is there.
