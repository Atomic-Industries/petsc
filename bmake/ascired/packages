#  This file contains site-specific information.  The definitions below
#  should be changed to match the locations of libraries at your site.
#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# FC_LIB contains the libraries for a CLINKER to use for code containing
# FORTRAN code (such as I/O or special Fortran runtimes).  
#
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  See ${PETSC_DIR}/docs/installation.html 
# for information on retrieving them.
#
BLAS_LIB       = /usr/local/intel/tflop/current/tflops/lib/libkmath.a
LAPACK_LIB     =  /usr/home/dswider/Lois/blaslapack/lapack.a
#
# Location of X-windows software
#
#X11_INCLUDE    =  -I/usr/X11R6/include
#X11_LIB        = -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11

# Location of MPI (Message Passing Interface) software

#  Locations of optional packages. Comment out those you do not have and change the 
#  values in PCONF below accordingly.

# Optional location of BlockSolve (MPI version)
# Note: using BlockSolve is incompatible with building PETSc with dynamic
# libraries on Sun4, this is because the shared library version of BlockSolve
# (which is required when BlockSolve is linked with dynamic libraries)
# does not build correctly because BlockSolve uses file names that get
# truncated with ar.

# comment out the locations indicated for that package above.
