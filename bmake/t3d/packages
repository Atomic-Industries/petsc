#  This file contains site-specific information.  The definitions below
#  should be changed to match the locations of libraries at your site.
#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  These are in the Cray library "sci"
# you may have to have "-lsci" or "/mpp/lib/libsci.a" before the FC_LIB below
# but probably can just leave them blank.
#
BLAS_LIB       = 
LAPACK_LIB     =

# Location of X-windows software: Cray T3d DOES NOT have X11 so you should 
# leave these blank.
#

X11_LIB        = 
#
# Location of MPI (Message Passing Interface) software
#
#  If you are using the MPICH implementation of MPI with version number
#  less then 1.1, you should remove the -DUSES_INT_MPI_COMM below.
#
#  We recommend using the Cray MPI, rather than MPICH.
#

#
# the -I/usr/include above is to insure that the C++ compiler with 
# complex finds the /usr/include/complex.h not /usr/include/mpp/complex.h
# which appears to be for C NOT c++.
