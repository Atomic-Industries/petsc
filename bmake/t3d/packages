#  should be changed to match the locations of libraries at your site.
#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# FCLIB contains the libraries for a CLINKER to use for code containing
# FORTRAN code (such as I/O or special Fortran runtimes). 
#
FC_LIB         = 
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  These libraries are available via Netlib,
# or see $(PETSC_DIR)/readme for information on retrieving a subset.
#
BLAS_LIB       = /mpp/lib/libsci.a $(FC_LIB)
LAPACK_LIB     = 
#
# Location of X-windows software (couldn't find on NERSc T3D)
#
X11_INCLUDE    = 
X11_LIB        = 
#
# Location of MPI (Message Passing Interface) software
#
MPI_LIB        = /mpp/lib/libmpi.a

#
# PCONF - indicates which external packages are available at your site
#
# I couldn't find X windows at NERSC so left this blank
# if you have X-windows on your T3D put -DHAVE_X11 below.
