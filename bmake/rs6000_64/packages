#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  See ${PETSC_DIR}/docs/installation.html
# for information on retrieving them.
# Important: If you use the IBM version of lapack you must include 
#  -lessl at the end of the line defining the BLAS libraries.
