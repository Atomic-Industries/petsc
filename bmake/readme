We have two approaches to generating machine independent make files.
The first is described below. The second preprocesses the makefile 
to generate input for the GNU configure program.

Variables in a PETSc makefile
  CFLAGS -
  ITOOLSDIR -
  MANSEC - the section the man pages should go in


Organization of base makefiles (files in bmake)
  sun4      - basic definitions (usually need not be changed except for 
              major change in compilers or make on your system.
  sun4.site - contains the locations of various libraries. May have
              to be hcanged to match your site.
  sun4.g    - defines debugging mode for system
  sun4.O    - defines optimizations for system.
  sun4.Opg  - optimization with profiler
  sun4.     - so that if user compiles without BOPT will not crash

Variables and rules defined in base make files:
  lib - rebuild the library in this directory if is is out of date.
        may be slow if large numbers of files need recompiling.
  libfast - compiles all the source in directory for library.
  manpages - build manual pages for directory
  C2f77 - builds Fortran 77 wrappers for all C functions.
  C2f77lib - compiles all the wrappers

  Each rule also has a corresponding *tree version that applies
  the rule to all subdirectories as well.

  CONF - the macros define by the configure program. For instance
         HAS_PWD_H. This way we can ifdef not by machine but
         instead by properties the machines has.
  
Limitations:
  1) Makefile must be called makefile.
  2) Each makefile can maintain at most one archive library.
