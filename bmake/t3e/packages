#  This file contains site-specific information.  The definitions below
#  should be changed to match the locations of libraries at your site.
#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  These are in the Cray library "sci"
# you may have to have "-lsci" or "/mpp/lib/libsci.a" on the BLAS_LIB line
#

#
# Location of X-windows software:
#
X11_INCLUDE    = 
X11_LIB        = -lX11
#
# Location of MPI (Message Passing Interface) software
#
#  If you are using the MPICH implementation of MPI with version number
#  less then 1.1, you should remove the -DPETSC_HAVE_INT_MPI_COMM below.
#
#  We recommend using Cray's implementation of MPI, rather than MPICH, 
#  for Cray's MPI you can leave MPI_LIB and MPI_INCLUDE as is.
