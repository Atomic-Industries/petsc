#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX

# FCLIB contains the libraries for a CLINKER to use for code containing
# FORTRAN code (such as I/O or special Fortran runtimes).

# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  These are in the Cray library "sci"
# you may have to have "-lsci" or "/mpp/lib/libsci.a" before the FC_LIB below

# Location of X-windows software:

# Location of MPI (Message Passing Interface) software
#
#  If you are using the MPICH implementation of MPI, you should remove the 
#  -DUSES_INT_MPI_COMM. This indicates that the MPI_Comm is defined to
#  be an integer.

# If you are not using Blocksolve then remove the -DHAVE_BLOCKSOLVE below 
# and comment out or remove the next two lines below.
#  Note that you cannot use BlockSolve with complex
