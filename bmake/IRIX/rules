# Notes:
#
# This version of PETSCFLAGS specifies the use of Fortran kernels (via
# -DPETSC_USE_FORTRAN_KERNELS) for several low-level computational kernels for
# complex numbers rather than using the potentially slower C++ versions.
# To instead use the C++ routines, remove -DPETSC_USE_FORTRAN_KERNELS from this
# list.
#
# For IRIX Release less than,6.2 the above should probably be replaced by
# FC_LIB         = -lfpe -lsun -lF77 -lU77 -lI77 -lisam
