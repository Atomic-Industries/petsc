#  This file contains site-specific information.  The definitions below
#  should be changed to match the locations of libraries at your site.
#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# FCLIB contains the libraries for a CLINKER to use for code containing
# FORTRAN code (such as I/O or special Fortran runtimes).

# For IRIX Release 6.2 the above should probably be replaced by
# FC_LIB         =  -lftn
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  These libraries are available via Netlib,
# or see $(BS_DIR)/readme for information on retrieving a subset.
# BLAS usually comes with SGI. Do NOT use mp version of the SGI BLAS.

# BlockSolve, then remove -DHAVE_BLOCKSOLVE from the PCONF definition
# below if it is there. You cannot use Blocksolve with complex

# Location of MPI (Message Passing Interface) software
#
#  If you are using the MPICH implementation of MPI with version below 1.1,
#  you should remove the -DUSES_INT_MPI_COMM. If you are using SGI's
#  version of MPI you MUST retain it.

#    Make sure that -DHAVE_BLOCKSOLVE is not listed below unless
#    BlockSolve95 has been installed.
