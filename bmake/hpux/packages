#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# FCLIB contains the libraries for a CLINKER to use for code containing
# FORTRAN code (such as I/O or special Fortran runtimes).

# or see $(PETSC_DIR)/readme for information on retrieving a subset.

# BlockSolve, then remove -DHAVE_BLOCKSOLVE from the PCONF definition
# below if it is there.
