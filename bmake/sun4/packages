#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# FCLIB contains the libraries for a CLINKER to use for code containing
# FORTRAN code (such as I/O or special Fortran runtimes).  
# The extra -lm is needed to force the C version of libm.a to 
# be searched before the Fortran 77 version.

# or see $(PETSC_DIR)/readme for information on retrieving a subset.

# If your machine has the file /usr/lang/SC3.0.1/lib/libsunperf.a then
