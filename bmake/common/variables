# PDIR (defined from $PETSC_DIR) determines where the PETSc libraries are built.
# LDIR defines location of libraries similar to PDIR. It can be reset by external packages like TAO.
# LDIR and PDIR will usually be identical for PETSc, and are different for 
# external packages that use the PETSc build system.
#
#    If you change PDIR in your makefile you MUST put it after the
#    include line
#
# LIBNAME       - library name
# SOURCE        - source files
# SSOURCE       - single precision versions of some source code
# OBJS          - object files
# SOBJS         - single precision versions of some object files
# PETSC_INCLUDE - locations of include files
# CPPFLAGS      - preprocessor flags for *.c, *.F preprocessing
# DOCS          - files that contain PETSc documentation, readmes etc.
# PETSC_PARCH   - corresponds to the PARCH_arch in the source files, set in 
#                 the file bmake/${PETSC_ARCH}/base
