# LDIR (defined from $PETSC_DIR) determines the libraries that are linked.
# PDIR (defined from $PETSC_DIR) determines where the libraries are built.
# LDIR and PDIR will usually be identical.

#    If you change PDIR in your makefile you MUST put it after the
#    include line
#

# SSOURCE       - single precision versions of some source code

# SOBJS         - single precision versions of some object files
# PETSC_INCLUDE - locations of include files
# CPPFLAGS      - preprocessor flags for *.c, *.F preprocessing
# DOCS          - files that contain PETSc documentation, readmes etc.
# PETSC_PARCH   - corresponds to the PARCH_arch in the source files, set in
