#  This file contains site-specific information.  The definitions below
#  should be changed to match the locations of libraries at your site.
#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# FCLIB contains the libraries for a CLINKER to use for code containing
# FORTRAN code (such as I/O or special Fortran runtimes).

# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  These libraries are available via Netlib,
# or see $(PETSC_DIR)/readme for information on retrieving a subset.
#
# BLAS usually comes with SGI and can be accessed with -lblas listed 
# below for BLAS_LIB. However, the complex BLAS routine izamax() has
# a bug in it, so if you are using complex numbers we recommend using
# the SGI BLAS with extreme care.

# BlockSolve, then remove -DHAVE_BLOCKSOLVE from the PCONF definition
