#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK. See ${PETSC_DIR}/docs/installation.html for information on 
# retrieving them.
# Important: If you use the IBM version of lapack you must include 
#  -lessl at the end of the line defining the BLAS libraries.
