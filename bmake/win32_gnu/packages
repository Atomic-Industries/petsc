#  This file contains site-specific information.  The definitions below

#  The following naming convention is used:

#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.

# You can also install PETSc without X, just comment out the 
# two lines below and remove the #define PETSC_HAVE_X11 from the file
# ../petscconf.h
