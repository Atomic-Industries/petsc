#  This file contains site-specific information.  The definitions below
#  should be changed to match the locations of libraries at your site.
#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
#  FC_LIB contains the libraries for a CLINKER to use for code containing
#  FORTRAN code (such as I/O or special Fortran runtimes).  
#  The extra -lm is needed to force the C version of libm.a to 
#  be searched before the Fortran 77 version.
#
FC_LIB         =  -lf2c -lm
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  These libraries are available via Netlib,
# or see $(PETSC_DIR)/readme for information on retrieving a subset.

#
# Location of MPI (Message Passing Interface) software
#
#  Unless you are using the p4 secure server you should remove the -p4ssport 1861 
# from below. If you are using the secure server you should put in the appropriate
# port number below instead of 1861

# and comment out or remove the next two lines.
