To solve linear systems, most users should employ the SLES component,
which provides a simplified interface to the combination of a Krylov
subspace iterative method and a preconditioner (in the KSP
and PC components, respectively).  SLES users can set various Krylov
subspace options at runtime via the options database (e.g., 
<font face ="Courier">
-ksp_type cg
</font face>
).  
SLES users can also set KSP options directly in application
codes by first extracting the KSP context from the SLES context via
<font face ="Courier">
SLESGetKSP()
</font face>
and then directly calling the KSP routines listed below (e.g., 
<font face ="Courier">
KSPSetType()
</font face>
).
While both KSP and PC components can be used directly to create and
destroy solvers, this approach is not recommended for most users (but
rather is intended primarily for library developers).
