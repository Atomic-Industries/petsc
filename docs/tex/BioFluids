  Isaac,

    We've been in contact with Prof. Francis Loth, University of Illinois at 
Chicago who is using FIDAP in biological modeling; specifically fluid flow
in arteries. He is typically running with 400,000 degrees of freedom and runs 
take weeks on PC or workstations. 

   He is interested in working with us on a scalable version of the simulations.
If at all possible, we'd like to continue to use some version of FIDAP since
it has served his purpose well so far. Do you folks have a distributed memory
parallel version of FIDAP or a subset that we might be able to use to get 
started? We would understand if it was incomplete and not fully developed but
are interested in getting started immediately in running faster in parallel.
