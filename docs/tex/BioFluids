Isaac,

    We've been in contact with Prof. Francis Loth, University of
Illinois at Chicago, who is using FIDAP in biological modeling --
specifically fluid flow in arteries. He is typically using about
400,000 degrees of freedom, and simulations take weeks on PCs or
workstations.

   He is interested in working with us on a scalable version of the
simulations.  If at all possible, we'd like to continue to use some
version of FIDAP since it has served his purpose well so far.  Do you
folks have a distributed memory parallel version of FIDAP or a subset
that we might be able to use to get started?  We would understand if
it is incomplete and not fully developed but are interested in getting
started immediately in running faster in parallel.
