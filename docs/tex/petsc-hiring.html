<tt>PETSc</tt> is made up of components that provide much of the 
functionality required for the parallel solution of partial 
differential equations.
  
  
<ul> 
 
<li><tt>Vec</tt> - provides all the vector operations required for setting
    up and solving large scale linear and nonlinear problems. Includes 
    easy to use parallel scatter and gather operations, as well as
    special purpose code for handling ghost points on regular data-structures.

<li><tt>Mat</tt> - a large suite of data structures and code  
      for the manipulation of parallel sparse matrices, includes four
      different parallel matrix data structures, each appropriate 
      for a different class of problems. 
 
<li><tt>PC</tt> - a collection of sequential and parallel preconditioners,  
      including (sequentially) ILU(k), LU, and (both sequentially and parallel)
      block Jacobi, overlapping additive Schwarz methods and (through
      BlockSolve95) ILU(0) and ICC(0).
  
<li><tt>KSP</tt> - parallel implementations of  
      many popular Krylov space iterative methods,  including GMRES, PCG, CGS,
      Bi-CG-stab, two varients of TFQM, CR, and LSQR. All are coded so as
      to be immediately usable with any preconditioners and any matrix data 
      structures including matrix free methods.
 
<li><tt>SNES</tt> - data-structure-neutral implementations of Newton-like  
      methods for nonlinear systems. Includes both line search and trust 
      region techniques with a single common interface. Offers advanced
      convergence criteria such as the Eisenstat-Walker criteria.
  
<li><tt>TS</tt> - code for evolution time evolution of solutions of PDEs. In addition,
      provides pseudo-transient continuation techniques for the computation of
      steady state solutions.

</ul>
