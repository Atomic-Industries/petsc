The PETSc development team in the Mathematics and Computer Science
(MCS) Division of Argonne National Laboratory invites candidates to
apply for a predoctoral or postdoctoral position to develop and
support the interoperability of the scalable algebraic solver package
PETSc and two parallel grid management packages: SAMRAI and
Overture. Information on these packages may be found at
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc, http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/SAMRAI and
http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/Overture. The applicant will work closely
with the PETSc team, as well as the SAMRAI and Overture groups, to
develop a complete infrastructure for the parallel solution of
PDEs using implicit and semi-implicit numerical methods. These
packages are already used at hundreds of sites for a wide variety of
applications, including CFD, structural mechanics, and multiphase flow.

We seek candidates with expertise in one or more of the following
areas: parallel numerical computing, software engineering, 
object-oriented programming, and the solution of large-scale applications 
on distributed-memory computers. Previous experience with MPI, PETSc,
Overture, or SAMRAI is highly desirable. C or C++ programming
experience is required. Candidates must have a degree in computer
science, applied mathematics, or an engineering discipline. The
appointment is available immediately.

The successful candidate will have access to state-of-the-art computing
and visualization facilities, including an 80-node IBM SP supercomputer and a
128-processor SGI Origin with 12 reality engine pipes running a CAVE
immersive visualization environment and several ImmersaDesks.

Predoctoral candidates must have received a master's degree within
three years prior to the beginning of the appointment. Initial
appointments are for one year and may be extended to a maximum of two
years.

Postdoctoral candidates must have received a Ph.D. degree not more
than three years prior to the beginning of the appointment. Initial
appointments are for one year and may be extended for two additional
years.

Argonne is located in the southwestern Chicago suburbs, offering the
advantages of affordable housing, good schools, and easy access to the
cultural attractions of the city.
