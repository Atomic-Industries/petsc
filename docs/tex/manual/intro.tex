This document provides a brief introduction to
the use of PETSc 2.0 for the numerical solution
of partial differential equations on high-performance computers.  The
Portable, Extensible, Toolkit for Scientific computation (PETSc), is a
suite of data structures and routines that provide the building
blocks for the solution of large-scale application codes on parallel
(and serial) computers.  PETSc 2.0 uses the MPI standard for all
message passing communication.

PETSc includes an expanding suite of parallel linear and nonlinear
equation solvers that are easily used in application codes written in
Fortran, C, and C++.  PETSc provides many of the mechanisms needed
within parallel application codes, such as simple parallel matrix and
vector assembly routines that allow the overlap of communication and
computation.  In addition, PETSc includes simple support for
distributed arrays.  The library is organized
hierarchically, enabling users to employ the level of abstraction that
is most appropriate for a particular problem. By using techniques 
of object oriented programming, PETSc provides enormous flexibility 
for users.

PETSc is a sophisticated set of software tools; as such, for some
users this may mean it initially has a steeper learning curve than a
simple subroutine library. However, the power of the PETSc design and
the algorithms it incorporates make the efficient implementation of
many application codes much simpler than ``rolling them'' yourself.

This document serves as the first section of the {\em PETSc 2.0 Users
Manual}, which elaborates on the use and design of PETSc 2.0. The
manual and is available in its entirety via the World Wide Web at
the PETSc home page, {\tt http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc.html}.
It is also available
by anonymous ftp at {\tt ftp://info.mcs.anl.gov/pub/petsc/manual.ps}.
