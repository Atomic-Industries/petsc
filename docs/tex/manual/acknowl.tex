We thank Victor Eijkhout for his valuable comments on this
manual as well as on the source code for PETSc 2.0.  We also thank David

Some of the source code and utility routines in PETSc have been
written by Cameron Cooper, Matt Hille, Peter Mell, and Wing-Lok Wan
while visiting Argonne National Laboratory as summer research
students.

PETSc uses routines from BLAS, LAPACK, MINPACK, SPARSPAK, and BlockSolve95 to
provide a small subset of its low-level functionality.
