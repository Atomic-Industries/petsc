\noindent {\bf Acknowledgments:}

\medskip \medskip \noindent
We thank all PETSc users for their many suggestions, bug reports, and
encouragement.  We especially thank Victor Eijkhout, David Keyes, and
Matthew Knepley for their valuable comments on the source code,
functionality, and documentation for PETSc 2.0.


\vspace{.3in}
\noindent
Some of the source code and utilities in PETSc (or software used by PETSc)
have been written by 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mark Adams, (scalability features of MPIBAIJ matrices),
  \item Allison Baker, (the flexible GMRES code)
  \item Tony Caola, (the SPARSEKIT2 ilutp() interface).
  \item Chad Carroll, (Win32 graphics).
  \item Cameron Cooper, (portions of the VecScatter routines), 
  \item Victor Eijkhout, (KSP type BICG, VecPipeline() and VecXXXBegin()/End() routines), 
  \item Paulo Goldfeld, (balancing Neumann-Neumann preconditioner)
  \item Matt Hille, 
  \item Matthew Knepley, (too much to mention),
  \item Domenico Lahaye, (the interface to John Ruge and Klaus Stueben's AMG),
  \item Peter Mell, (portions of the DA routines),
  \item Todd Munson, (the LUSOL (sparse solver in MINOS) interface)
  \item Wing-Lok Wan, (the ILU portion of BlockSolve95),
  \item Liyang Xu, (the interface to PVODE)
\end{itemize}

PETSc uses routines from 
\begin{itemize}
  \item BLAS
  \item LAPACK
  \item LINPACK      (matrix factorization and solve; converted to C using {\tt f2c} and then 
                      hand-optimized for small matrix sizes, for block matrix data structures),
  \item MINPACK      (sequential matrix coloring routines for finite difference Jacobian
                       evaluations; converted to C using {\tt f2c}),
  \item SPARSPAK     (matrix reordering routines, converted to C using {\tt f2c}),
  \item SPARSEKIT2 (written by Yousef Saad) (iludtp(), converted to C using {\tt f2c}). These routines 
                     are copyrighted by Saad under the GNU copyright, see \url{${PETSC_DIR}/src/mat/impls/aij/seq/gnu}),
  \item libtfs (the efficient, parallel direct solver developed by Henry Tufo and Paul Fischer).
\end{itemize}


\vspace{.3in}
\noindent
PETSc interfaces to the following external software:
\begin{itemize}
  \item AMG          (the algebraic multigrid code of John Ruge and Klaus Stueben)
  \item BlockSolve95 (for parallel ICC(0) and ILU(0) preconditioning)
  \item ESSL         (IBM's math library for fast sparse direct LU factorization)
  \item Matlab       
  \item ParMeTiS      (parallel graph partitioner)
  \item PVODE        (parallel ODE integrator)
  \item SPAI         (for parallel sparse approximate inverse preconditiong)
  \item LUSOL        (sparse LU factorization code (part of MINOS) developed by Michael Saunders,
                      Systems Optimization Laboratory, Stanford University).
\end{itemize}
These are all optional packages and do not need to be installed to use PETSc.
