The development of TAO is supported by the Office of Advanced Scientific 
Computing Research, Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy, under 
Contract DE-AC02-06CH11357.  

TAO relies on PETSc for the linear algebra required to solve optimization
problems and we have benefitted from their experience, tools, software, 
and advice. In many ways, TAO is a natural outcome of the PETSc development.

We thank the Argonne Laboratory Computing Resource Center and National
Energy Research Scientific Computing Center for allowing us to test and
run TAO applications on their machines.

TAO has also benefitted from the work of various researchers who have provided 
solvers, test problems, and interfaces.  In particular, we acknowledge Lisa 
Grignon, Elizabeth Dolan, Boyana Norris, Gabriel Lopez-Calva, Yurii Zinchenko, 
Michael Gertz, Jarek Nieplocha, Limin Zhang, Manojkumar Krishnan, and Evan 
Gawlik. Thanks to Jorge Mor\'e for his leadership, vision, and effort on 
previous versions of TAO.

Finally, we thank all TAO users for their comments, bug reports, and
encouragement.
