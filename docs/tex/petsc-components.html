<tt>PETSc</tt> is made up of components that provide much of the 
functionality required for the parallel solution of partial 
differential equations.
  
  
<ul> 
 
<li><tt>Vec</tt> - Provides the vector operations required for setting
    up and solving large-scale linear and nonlinear problems. Includes 
    easy-to-use parallel scatter and gather operations, as well as
    special-purpose code for handling ghost points for regular data structures.

<li><tt>Mat</tt> - A large suite of data structures and code  
      for the manipulation of parallel sparse matrices.   Includes four
      different parallel matrix data structures, each appropriate 
      for a different class of problems. 
 
<li><tt>PC</tt> - A collection of sequential and parallel preconditioners,  
      including (sequential) ILU(k), LU, and (both sequential and parallel)
      block Jacobi, overlapping additive Schwarz methods and (through
      BlockSolve95) ILU(0) and ICC(0).
  
<li><tt>KSP</tt> - Parallel implementations of  
      many popular Krylov subspace iterative methods, including GMRES, CG, CGS,
      Bi-CG-Stab, two variants of TFQMR, CR, and LSQR.  All are coded so that
      they are immediately usable with any preconditioners and any matrix data 
      structures, including matrix-free methods.
 
<li><tt>SNES</tt> - Data-structure-neutral implementations of Newton-like  
      methods for nonlinear systems. Includes both line search and trust 
      region techniques with a single interface.  Employs the above
      (uniprocessor and parallel)  data structures and linear solvers.
      Users can set custom monitoring routines, convergence criteria, etc.
  
<li><tt>TS</tt> - Code for the time evolution of solutions of PDEs. In addition,
      provides pseudo-transient continuation techniques for computing
      steady-state solutions.
