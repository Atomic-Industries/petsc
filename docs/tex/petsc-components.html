<tt>PETSc</tt>, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation,  
is a suite of uni- and parallel-processor codes that are intended for  
the solution of large-scale problems modeled by partial differential  
equations.  <tt>PETSc</tt> employs the MPI standard for all  
message-passing communication.  The code is written in a  
data-structure-neutral manner to enable easy reuse and flexibility.  
<P> 
<tt> PETSc</tt> is easy to use for beginners.  Moreover, its careful  
design allows advanced users to have detailed control over the  
solution process. <tt>PETSc</tt> includes an expanding suite of parallel  
linear and nonlinear equation solvers that are easily used in  
application codes written in C, C++, and Fortran.  <tt>PETSc</tt>  
provides many of the mechanisms needed within parallel application  
codes, such as simple parallel matrix and vector assembly routines  
that allow the overlap of communication and computation.  In addition,  
<tt>PETSc</tt> includes growing support for distributed arrays.  
<P> 
<tt>PETSc</tt> integrates a hierarchy of components, thus  
enabling the user to employ the level of abstraction that is most  
natural for a particular problem.  Some of the components are  
  
<ul> 
 
<li><tt>Mat</tt> - a suite of data structures and code  
      for the manipulation of parallel sparse matrices,  
  
 
<li><tt>PC</tt> - a collection of preconditioners,  
  
 
<li><tt>KSP</tt> - data-structure-neutral implementations of  
      many popular Krylov space iterative methods,  
  
 
<li><tt>SLES</tt> - a higher-level interface for the solution of  
      large-scale linear systems, and  
  
 
<li><tt>SNES</tt> - data-structure-neutral implementations of Newton-like  
      methods for nonlinear systems.  
</ul>

<HR><H1><A NAME="Node1">Applications</a></H1>
<tt>PETSc</tt> is intended for use in large-scale application projects, and  
several ongoing computational science projects at Argonne  
and other institutions are built around the <tt>PETSc</tt> framework.  
With strict attention to component interoperability, <tt>PETSc</tt>  
facilitates the integration of independently developed application  
modules, which often most naturally employ different coding styles and  
data structures.   
<P> 

<P>
<HR><H1><A NAME="Node2">Computational Environment</a></H1>
<tt>PETSc</tt> is available on Sun, DEC Alpha, Silicon Graphics, HP-UX, and IBM  
RS/6000 workstations; IBM PCs running FreeBSD or Linux; the Cray T3D,  
the Intel Paragon; and the IBM SP.
