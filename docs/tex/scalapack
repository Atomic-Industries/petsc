| 
|   PETSc is not replacement or competitor to Scalapack
| or Lapack. Rather it is a complementary package that
| provides the infrastructure and software for the large scale 
| (possibly parallel) numerical solution of partial
| differential equations. Scalapack and Lapack are not
| intended for this class of problems.

I like the idea, but I believe that it is important to note that to PETSc,
Scalapack and Lapack are like sin or sqrt - routines that can be used in
special cases, and that PETSc, in addition to providing a higher-level of
functionality and abstraction, provides transparent access to such
special-purpose libraries.
