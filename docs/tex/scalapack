I like the idea, but I believe that it is important to note that to PETSc,
Scalapack and Lapack are like sin or sqrt - routines that can be used in
special cases, and that PETSc, in addition to providing a higher-level of
functionality and abstraction, provides transparent access to such
special-purpose libraries.

I don't like this part here because lapack scalapack and minpack 
don't relly address any part of lsrge scale (or even small scale)
PDEs.
