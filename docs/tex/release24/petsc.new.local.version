Subject: new local PETSc installation


We have installed a new local version of PETSc (version 2.0.17)
in /home/petsc/petsc.solid.  Please see the file
/home/petsc/petsc.solid/Changes for new features and changes 
in the software.

The previous two versions (PETSc 2.0.15 and 2.0.16) are located in
/home/petsc/petsc-2.0.15 and /home/petsc/petsc-2.0.16.  Please try 
using the new code when you have a chance.  Please only revert to the
previous version in case of emergency.  Be sure to let us know by
writing to petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov if you experience any problems with
the new code, as we should be able to resolve them quickly.  Also,
let us know if you need to use a variant of PETSc-2.0.17 that hasn't
been built (by specifying the needed PETSC_ARCH and BOPT).

Thanks for your support.
Barry, Satish, Bill, and Lois
