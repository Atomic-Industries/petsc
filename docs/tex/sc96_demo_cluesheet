What: Demo of PETSc software.  One demo provides an interface to
        - PETSc home page, users manual, man pages
        - software tools: PETScView and PETScOpts
        - example applications:
            - solid fuel ignition problem
            - Euler flow model
                - running Euler code to produce VRML output
                  for display in the Immersadesk


Why:  PETSc is a library for portable, parallel (and serial) scientific
      computation that employs the MPI standard for message-passing
      communication.  PETSc integrates a hierarchy of modules that range
      from low-level distributed data structures through high-level
      nonlinear solvers, thus enabling users to employ the level of
      abstraction that is most appropriate for a particular problem.

      See the 1-page handout entitled "PETSc" for more info.

How:  Running the PETSc demo:

 The PETSc demo uses Tcl/Tk.  The demo can be displayed on both sun4 and
 rs6000 machines (but not IRIX machines -- since the font sizes are huge
 and distort the overall demo appearance; there's probably a way to fix
 this but I don't know what it is now).  

 Regardless of the display, however, THE DEMO SHOULD BE RUN ON A SUN4
 machine (since rs6000 machines are giving various Netscape error messages).

 Note:  The Tcl/Tk path used in all demo files is:
    /home/petsc/bin/sun4/wish4.1
 which is a link to the appropriate sun4 version.  Alternatively,
 if running on a rs6000 machine (which is not recommended due to
 the Netscape problems), this path MUST be changed to 
    /usr/local/bin/wish4.1

      1.  Set the following environmental variable:
              setenv PETSC_DIR /home/petsc/petsc

      2.  Type '/home/petsc/petsc/bin/petscdemo' to start a PETSc
          demo session.  

      3.  Click on various options within the demo menu for
          additional demos and information (e.g., 'Application Examples'
          and 'Solid Fuel Ignition' for info about a sample PETSc
          application problem.

      5.  To exit the PETSc demo session, click on 'Exit'.

             - details of PETSc design philosophy
             - on-line PETSc documentation:  
                  - man pages 
                  - users manual 
             - PETSc source code and examples
