Dear T3E Users,

SGI/Cray Research is offering a t-shirt to anyone who completely answers the
questionnaire below.  This is not a NERSC survey.  If you wish to give your
input to SGI/Cray please respond directly to Steve Caruso, caruso@cray.com.

Sincerely,

********************************T3E Apps Questions*************************
Dear Customer,

We at the Cray Research division of Silicon Graphics are engaged in
making decisions regarding future architectures for high performance
computer systems.

We want future systems to be logical follow ons to current CRI
systems, such as the Cray T3E.  We would greatly appreciate any help
you could give us on the questions below:

   a) is the code 'home grown' or a third party code?

   b) what is the range of per-processor performance levels (in MFLOPS) for
      different runs on T3E?  If earlier versions of the code existed on
      Cray vector machines, what were the per-processor performance levels
      on those machines?  Were earlier versions of the code routinely run
      on data parallel machines, like the CM-2 or CM-5?

   c) are the algorithms used in the code 'naturally' written in a
      non-vector- izeable form (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation is easily
      written as scalar but  is vectorizeable only with much difficulty and
      complexity),
      OR, 
      are the algorithms naturally written as short vector loops (with
      good locality that typically run well on cache-based micro-processors
      but poorly on traditional vector machines), OR, could the algorithms
      easily be written as mostly long  vector loops?

   d) is the code, as it exists on the T3E today, mostly vectorizeable or
      does the current form have mostly scalar inner loops?  If the T3E
      version of the code has mostly vectorizeable loops, what is the typical
      range of loop lengths of these inner loops?

   e) have the authors of the code done source-level optimization for the
      T3E, and would they consider additional optimizations for future
      computer architectures?  Would we (CRI) be able to see examples of the
      "before" and "after" source code?

   f) if we need more detailed information, would there be anyone on site who
      would be able to help us with profiling information, source access, etc?
