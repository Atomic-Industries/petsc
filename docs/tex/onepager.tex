\section*{Description}

\code{PETSc}, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation,
is a suite of libraries for
the solution of large-scale problems modeled by partial differential
equations.  \code{PETSc} employs the MPI standard for all
message-passing communication. 

\code{PETSc} integrates a hierarchy of components including
\vspace{-.4cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{Mat} - a suite of data structures and code
      for the manipulation of parallel sparse matrices,
\vsp
\item \code{PC} - a large collection of preconditioners, including support for multigrid,
\vsp
\item \code{KSP} - data-structure-neutral implementations of
      many popular Krylov subspace iterative methods,
\vsp
\item \code{SNES} - data-structure-neutral implementations of Newton-like
      methods for nonlinear systems, and
\vsp
\item \code{TS} - timestepping code for the scalable solution of
      nonlinear ODEs arising from applying general ``methods of lines'' 
      techniques to time-dependent PDEs. Includes support for 
      pseudo-timestepping. 
\end{itemize}
\vsp

\code{ PETSc} integrates with (uses some of the functionality of) over a dozen other packages including: ParMeTiS, PVODE, ADIC, ADIFOR,
Matlab, SuperLU, and AMG. 
\vsp

\code{ PETSc} is easy to use for beginners.  Moreover, its careful
design gives advanced users detailed control over the
solution process. \code{PETSc} includes an expanding suite of parallel
linear and nonlinear equation solvers that are easily used in
application codes written in C, C++, and Fortran.  \code{PETSc} also
provides many of the mechanisms needed within parallel application
codes, such as parallel matrix and vector assembly routines
that allow the overlap of communication and computation.  In addition,
\code{PETSc} includes growing support for the management of structured and
unstructured grid data.

\section*{Applications}
\code{PETSc} is intended for use in large-scale application projects,
and several ongoing computational science projects at Argonne and
other institutions are built around these tools.  
One such application for a fully unstructured, fully implicit Euler
solver was a "special category" winner in the 1999 Gordon Bell
competition at SC99 with a rate of over 225 Gflops on the ASCI
Red machine. Other applications include structural mechanics, multiphase flow, electromagnetics,
control of Navier-Stokes, wave propagation, biomechanical simulations, plasticity, and econometrics.


% This code also achieved a 95\% efficiency in going from
% 256 to 2048 processors and over 70 Gflops on 1280 processors of the
% Cray T3E.

\section*{Availability}

\code{PETSc} package is freely available and supported (via email at petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov).
The \code{PETSc} distribution contains all source code, 
a users guide, manual pages, and a
collection of examples. There are over 300 members of the \code{PETSc}-users mailing list and
over 4000 downloads of the software.

\section*{Computational Environment}
\code{PETSc} is available for Linux, Sun, DEC Alpha, Silicon Graphics, HP-UX, Windows, 
and IBM workstations; the Cray T3E; the IBM SP; the SGI Origin; and the HP Exemplar.
