\section*{Description}

\code{PETSc}, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation,
is a suite of uni- and parallel-processor tools that are
intended especially for the solution of large-scale problems modeled
by partial differential equations.
\code{PETSc} employs the MPI standard for all
message-passing communication.  Most of the code is written in a
data-structure-neutral manner to enable easy reuse and flexibility.

\code{PETSc} integrates a hierarchy of components, all of which
are naturally and easily used in parallel from C, C++, and Fortran,
thus enabling the user to employ the level of abstraction that is 
most natural for a particular problem.  Some of the components include:

\vspace{-.4cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{Mat} - a large suite of data structures and code
      for the manipulation of parallel sparse matrices,
\vsp
\item \code{PC} - a small, but growing collection of preconditioners,
\vsp
\item \code{KSP} - data-structure-neutral implementations of
      many popular Krylov space iterative methods,
\vsp
\item \code{SLES} - a higher-level interface to a variety
      of preconditioners and Krylov space methods,
\vsp
\item \code{SNES} - data-structure-neutral implementations of Newton-like
      methods for nonlinear systems.
\vsp
\item In addition, we are developing code for manipulating grids
      and discretizations in parallel.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Applications}
\code{PETSc} is intended for use in large-scale application projects, and
several ongoing multi-site computational science projects at Argonne and
other institutions are built around the \code{PETSc} framework.
With strict attention to component interoperability, \code{PETSc}
facilitates the integration of independently developed modules, which
often most naturally employ different coding styles and data
structures.  In addition, users can seemlessly replace models as well
as combine and nest algorithms.

\section*{Computational Environment}
\code{PETSc} is available on Sun, DEC alpha, Silicon Graphics, HP-UX, and IBM
RS/6000 workstations; IBM PCs running freeBSD or Linux; the Cray T3D,
Intel Paragon and the IBM SP. Other machines may be supported as our
resources permit.

\section*{Availability}

The \code{PETSc} package is freely available.
The complete distribution can be obtained by anonymous ftp from 
\URL{ftp://info.mcs.anl.gov/pub/petsc}.

\section*{Documentation}

The \code{PETSc} distribution contains all source code, 
installation instructions,
a users guide in both PostScript and HTML formats, 
{\tt man pages} for all routines,
and a collection of examples.
