\section*{Description}

\code{PETSc} is a large toolkit of software for portable, 
parallel (and serial) scientific computation. Most of the 
code is written in a data-structure-neutral manner to 
allow for easy reuse and flexibility.
The \code{PETSc} software may be used with either C or Fortran.
\code{PETSc} includes several packages:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{Chameleon}  - A portable interface to most 
popular message-passing systems including {\tt p4} and {\tt PVM} and 
a large number of vendor-provided message-passing systems
that run on the Intel, Thinking Machines, and IBM parallel 
machines. Code written using \code{Chameleon} is completely 
portable across these machines.
\code{Chameleon} also provides both an MPI implementation and an MPI 
transport layer.  
\item \code{BlockComm}  - A higher-level communications package
for the distribution of regular, array based data structures.
\item \code{KSP} - A data-structure-neutral implementation of
many popular Krylov space iterative methods suitable for 
serial or parallel machines.
\item \code{SLES} - A higher-level interface to a variety
of preconditioners and Krylov space methods.
\item \code{SMEIT} - A large suite of data structures and code
for the manipulation of sparse matrices.
\item \code{SNES} - Data-structure-neutral 
implementations of trust region and line search Newton's 
method for the solution of nonlinear systems. \code{SNES} runs 
on both serial and parallel machines.  
\item \code{Extensible PDE Solvers} - A package for the solution of 
elliptic PDEs using either finite elements or finite differences in 
two or three dimensions on either structured or unstructured grids.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Computational Environment}
\code{PETSc} is available on Sun, DEC, Silicon Graphics, and IBM
RS/6000 workstations; IBM SP; Intel iPSC/860, DELTA, and Paragon;
Convex; and Cray machines.

\section*{Availability}

The \code{PETSc} package is freely available.
The complete distribution can be obtained by anonymous ftp from 
\hcitea{petsc-ftp-dir}{info.mcs.anl.gov} in the directory pub/pdetools.  

\section*{Documentation}

The \code{PETSc} distribution contains all source code, 
installation instructions,
a users guide in both ASCII text and latexinfo format, 
\hcitea{petsc-man-pages}{man pages},
and a collection of examples in both C and Fortran.  
Additional information is available via the WWW at
