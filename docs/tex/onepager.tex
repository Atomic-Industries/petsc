\section*{Description}

\code{PETSc}, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation,
is a large software library for portable, parallel (and serial)
scientific computation that employs the MPI standard for message
passing communication.  Most of the code is written in a
data-structure-neutral manner to enable easy reuse and flexibility.
The \code{PETSc} software can be used with C, C++, and Fortran.
\code{PETSc} includes several components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{Mat} - A large suite of data structures and code
      for the manipulation of parallel sparse matrices.
\item \code{PC} - A small, but growing collection of serial and parallel 
      preconditioners.
\item \code{KSP} - A data-structure-neutral implementation of
      many popular Krylov space iterative methods suitable for 
      serial and parallel machines.
\item \code{SLES} - A higher-level interface to a variety
      of preconditioners and Krylov space methods.
\item \code{SNES} - Data-structure-neutral 
      implementations of trust region and line search Newton's 
      method for the solution of nonlinear systems. \code{SNES} runs 
      on both serial and parallel machines.  
\item In addition, we are developing code for manipulating grids
      and discretizations in parallel.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Computational Environment}
\code{PETSc} is available on Sun, DEC, Silicon Graphics, and IBM
RS/6000 workstations, as well as IBM PCs running freeBSD and the
IBM SP. Other machines will be supported as our resources permit.

\section*{Availability}

The \code{PETSc} package is freely available.
The complete distribution can be obtained by anonymous ftp from 
\URL{ftp://info.mcs.anl.gov/pub/petsc}.

\section*{Documentation}

The \code{PETSc} distribution contains all source code, 
installation instructions,
a users' guide in both postscript and html formats, 
{\tt man pages} for all routines,
and a collection of examples.
Additional information is available via the WWW at
