\section*{Description}

\code{PETSc}, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation,
is a software library for portable, parallel (and serial)
scientific computation that employs the MPI standard for message-
passing communication.  Most of the code is written in a
data-structure-neutral manner to enable easy reuse and flexibility.
The \code{PETSc} software can be used with C, C++, and Fortran.
\code{PETSc} includes several components. 

All \code{PETSc} are naturally and easily used in parallel.

\vspace{-.6cm}

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{Mat} - A large suite of data structures and code
      for the manipulation of parallel sparse matrices.
\item \code{PC} - A small, but growing collection of preconditioners.
\item \code{KSP} - A data-structure-neutral implementation of
      many popular Krylov space iterative methods.
\item \code{SLES} - A higher-level interface to a variety
      of preconditioners and Krylov space methods.
\item \code{SNES} - Data-structure-neutral 
      implementations of trust region and line search Newton's 
      method for the solution of nonlinear systems. 
\item In addition, we are developing code for manipulating grids
      and discretizations in parallel.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Applications}
\code{PETSc} is designed for large scale application projects. 
Several ongoing Argonne computational science projects are 
built around the \code{PETSc} framework.

\section*{Computational Environment}
\code{PETSc} is available on Sun, DEC, Silicon Graphics, HP-UX, and IBM
RS/6000 workstations; IBM PCs running freeBSD; and the
IBM SP. Other machines will be supported as our resources permit.

\section*{Availability}

The \code{PETSc} package is freely available.
The complete distribution can be obtained by anonymous ftp from 
\URL{ftp://info.mcs.anl.gov/pub/petsc}.

\section*{Documentation}

The \code{PETSc} distribution contains all source code, 
installation instructions,
a users guide in Poth postscript and html formats, 
{\tt man pages} for all routines,
and a collection of examples.
Additional information is available via the WWW at
