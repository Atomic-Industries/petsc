PETSc names that should be changed.

 - files: ksp/interface/itXXXX -> kspXXX

 - VecAXBY ->? VecAXPBY
     - more consistent with other Vec routines

 - PLogXXX ->? PetscLogXXX  
     - unique to PETSc so no chance of conflicts with external software,
       but longer

 - VecValidVector ->? VecValid
   MatValidMatrix ->? MatValid

 - PCBSIterSetBlockSolve -> move into pc? (Right now the man page is in mat)
