PETSc names that should be changed.

 - files: ksp/interface/itXXXX -> kspXXX

 - VecAXBY ->? VecAXPBY
     - more consistent with other Vec routines
  (perhaps redue all stupid old BLAS names)

 - PLogXXX ->? PetscLogXXX  
     - unique to PETSc so no chance of conflicts with external software,
       but longer

 - VecValidVector ->? VecValid
   MatValidMatrix ->? MatValid (Similar to MatEqual)

 - PCBSIterSetBlockSolve -> move into pc? (Right now the man page is in mat)

 - MGSetR ->??? ( Do not know much aboug MG, but probably "R" could be expanded - satish)
   MGSetX

 - ViewerStringsprintf -> ViewerStringsPrintf /ViewerStringSprintf? ?? (ambigious)
   (was done in this funny way because sprintf does not have caps, 
    not PetscMemcpy whoops looks like maybe should be changed

 - MPIU_* inconsistant for eg: MPIU_Comm_dup , MPIU_printf
   MPIU_printf ->? MPIU_Printf;

 - SY -> Petsc? or PetscMem* ->? SYMem*
        
 - SYGetwd ->? SYGetWD (will be more consistant but ugly? satish)
              prob SYGetWorkingDirectory() to be consistant with SYGetHomeDirectory() GetWorkingDirectory is best.

   SYIsort ->  SYISort etc...  Or SYIntSort


 - Tr -> TR?
