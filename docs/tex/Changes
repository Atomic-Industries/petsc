  This is list of recent PETSc changes before they are 
transported into the docs/changes.html file. (Because it
is a pain to always check that file out of SourceSafe to 
add to it).

  MAT

    Added to additional arguments to MatCreate(MPI_Comm comm,int m,int n,int M,int N,Mat *)
    where m and n are the local ownership sizes. To get the effect of the old MatCreate()
    use m and n equal to PETSC_DECIDE
