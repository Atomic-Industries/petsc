  This is list of recent PETSc changes before they are 
transported into the docs/changes.html file. (Because it
is a pain to always check that file out of SourceSafe to 
add to it).

  VEC


  MAT

   Changed MatDiagonalShift(Mat,Vec) to MatDiagonalSet(Mat,Vec,InsertMode);
   Dropped the second to last argument to MatCreateRowbs()
  

  KSP

  KSP now contains a Minres solver.
    Contibuted by: Robert Scheichl: maprs@maths.bath.ac.uk


  SLES
 

  PC

added -pc_ilu_damping and -pc_lu_damping PCLUSetDamping(), ILU for handling singular
or matrices that generate a zero pivot.  

  MGSetLevels() now takes an additional optional final argument that is an array
of communicators to use on the SLES on each level
 
  AO

    

  IS

   ISEqual now is collective and returns true only if each processor has the same
   indices 

   ISGetSize() now returns global parallel size, ISGetLocalSize() returns local size

  PF
    added the type PFMATLAB with -pf_type matlab -pf_matlab matlab_commands  

  Draw
  

  General

   Added support for PETSc programs to use Matlab functions and scripts on each processor
   for sequential calculations; for example for the local evaluation of the parallel nonlinear
   function required for SNES; see src/snes/examples/tutorials/ex5m.c. This functionality
   is accessed via the commands PetscMatlabEngineCreate(),Put(),Get(),Evaluate() and Destroy()
   It even imports the Matlab flop counts correctly. Obviously you need enough Matlab licenses
   for each node. Note: Matlab itself is not directly doing any parallel computing.

   In addition, augmented the SeqAIJ matrices to support -mat_aij_matlab that causes the 
   matrices to use the Matlab engine for sparse LU, and ILUDT factorization and solves. 
   Which have pivoting and thus are more robust than PETSc's default.

   I, of course, could do more, any suggestions?

   All include files like mat.h vec.h sles.h snes.h ts.h etc are now changed to petscmat.h petscvec.h
   petscsles.h petscsnes.h petscts.h

  added PetscSetHelpVersionFunctions() for developers of other libraries that use PETSc.

  added PetscPoUpSelect(), see src/sys/examples/tests/ex15.c

  added int PetscShowMemoryUsage(Viewer viewer,char *message)

  added PreLoadBegin(), PreLoadStage() and PreLoadEnd() to simplify getting
  accurate timings by peloading. See src/snes/examples/tutorials/ex10.c

  added PetscSynchronizedFGets()

  If you use PreLoadBegin() etc the preloaded stages will not be printed in the -log_summary output

  Viewers

added EXTERN Viewer VIEWER_BINARY_(MPI_Comm);
 #define VIEWER_BINARY_WORLD VIEWER_BINARY_(PETSC_COMM_WORLD)
#define VIEWER_BINARY_SELF  VIEWER_BINARY_(PETSC_COMM_SELF)
also added options -vec_view_binary and -mat_view_binary


  SNES 

  The second argument to MatSNESMFSetType() is now a MatSNESMFType, rather than
 a char*. This should not affect any user code. Current built in choices are
 MATSNESMF_DEFAULT "default" and MATSNESMF_WP "wp"

  SNESGetJacobian() now has an additional optional final argument that can return the function pointer

  SNESGetFunction() now has an additional optional final argument that can return the function pointer

  DA

  added -da_noao for DACreateXXX() makes them more scalable, but cannot use the natural numbering
  DA routines with this option.
