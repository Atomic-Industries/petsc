  This is list of recent PETSc changes before they are 
transported into the docs/changes.html file. (Because it
is a pain to always check that file out of SourceSafe to 
add to it).

  MAT


added matrix option MAT_KEEP_ZEROED_ROWS causes MatZeroRows() to keep the original nonzero 
data structure and just put 0.0 into the elements that are to be zeroed. Without this option
it removes the locations from the nonzero structure
