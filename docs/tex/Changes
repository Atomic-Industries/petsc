  This is list of recent PETSc changes before they are 
transported into the docs/changes.html file. (Because it
is a pain to always check that file out of SourceSafe to 
add to it).

  VEC

     All VecGetArray() must now be matched with a VecRestoreArray()   

  MAT

    Fixed bugs in MatReorderForNonzeroDiagonal() and made it more
    robust.   

    Fixed bugs in factorization for AIJ matrices with variable size
    inodes
   

  KSP

    
    
  PC

    

  AO

    

  IS

    

  General

    Added OptionsGetLogical()

    Remove the gvec directory from the distribution. If you are using this
 please let us and know and we can provide it or provide alternative code
to do what you need.

    Moved all the compiler/optimization information for each PETSC_ARCH
    from the various base.g, base.O_c++ etc files all into the single file
    base. Now configuration for your system should require only editing
    ${PETSC_ARCH}/base and ${PETSC_ARCH}/base.site

    The PETSC_ARCH rs6000 is now for IBM rs6000 workstations running MPICH or LAM
    while rs6000_sp is for IBM SPs.

    We now included PETSC_ARCH of solaris_gnu, rs6000_gnu for those systems
    when using the gnu compilers

    Thanks to the generosity of the FreeBSD organization we are now supporting
    freebsd again

    Added optional filename to -log_info <filename> option. PETSc will open
  a seperate file, called filename.rank for each processor and print the 
  output there.

    Added PetscTypeCompare(), see the manual page

  Viewer

    Changed ViewerFileOpenASCII() to ViewerASCIIOpen()

    Changed ViewerDrawOpenX() to ViewerDrawOpen()

    Changed ViewerFileOpenBinary() to ViewerBinaryOpen()

    Changed ViewerDrawOpenX() to ViewerDrawOpen()

    Changed ViewerType from an enum to a char *

  SNES 

    Changed SNESDefaultMatrixFreeMatCreate() to MatSNESFDMFCreate()
    Added 
      MatSNESFDMFSetHHistory(Mat,Scalar *,int);
      MatSNESFDMFResetHHistory(Mat,Scalar *,int);
      MatSNESFDMFSetParameters(Mat,double,double);
      MatSNESFDMFGetH(Mat,Scalar *);
      MatSNESFDMFKSPMonitor(KSP,int,double,void *); and the 
      option -snes_mf_ksp_monitr
    Added support for an alternative way to compute h using the Walker-Pernice
      strategy accessible via -snes_mf_type wp
