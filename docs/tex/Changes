  This is list of recent PETSc changes before they are 
transported into the docs/changes.html file. (Because it
is a pain to always check that file out of SourceSafe to 
add to it).

  Changed VecGetDistributedVector() and VecGetLocalVector() to 
  VecCreateGlobalVector() and VecGetLocalVector(); only user interface
  difference is that now each call to these with the same DA will generate
  a new vector rather than always refering to the same original one as it
  use to work. You should still destroy the vectors when finished with them
  with a call to VecDestroy().

  Added VecSetBlockSize(), VecSetValuesBlocked(), VecSetValuesBlockedLocal()
        VecSetLocalToGlobalMappingBlocked()

  Changed docs/www to docs/manualpages and docs/www/www.html docs/manualpages/manualpages.html

  Added VecCreateShared()


  Added the argument column size to the routine MatGetSubMatrix()

  added MatGetColumnVector()

  added -log_summary_exclude <vec,mat,sles,snes>

  Changed indication of exclusion of info from -log_info <no_vec,no_mat etc> to 
  -log_info_exclude <vec,mat,etc.>

  changed VEC_IGNORE_OFF_PROCESSOR_VALUES to 
     VEC_IGNORE_OFF_PROC_ENTRIES
