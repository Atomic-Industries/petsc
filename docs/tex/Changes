  This is list of recent PETSc changes before they are 
transported into the docs/changes.html file. (Because it
is a pain to always check that file out of SourceSafe to 
add to it).

  VEC

     

     

  MAT

  MatSolveTrans() and MatSolveTransAdd() are now MatSolveTransposeXXX()
  MatMultTrans() and MatMultTransAdd() are now MatMultTransposeXXX()

  Another MatSetOption, MAT_IGNORE_ZERO_ENTRIES for AIJ matrices with ADD_VALUES.

added matrix option MAT_KEEP_ZEROED_ROWS causes MatZeroRows() to keep the original nonzero 
data structure and just put 0.0 into the elements that are to be zeroed. Without this option
it removes the locations from the nonzero structure    

  KSP

    KSPSolvetrans() is now KSPSolveTranspose()

     Added flexible gmres (use gmres or KSPGMRES as the type) see KSPFGMRESSetModifyPC() for
   how to change PC at each iteration.

  SLES
 
SLESSolveTrans() is now SLESSolveTranspose()

  SLESSolve() now ALWAYS returns a 0 or positive iteration count. Call KSPGeeytConvergedReason()
to see if converged or diverged and why.   

  PC

  PCApplyTrans() is now PCApplyTranspose()

  optiions -pc_ilu_mat_ordering_type <nd,...> and  -pc_lu_mat_ordering_type <nd,...> now set 
  the ordering type.

  We now provide a drop tolerance based ILU for SeqAIJ matrix format via Yousef Saad's SPARSEKIT2
  software.

Use -pc_ilu_use_drop_tolerance <dt,dtcol,rowmax> or
PCILUSetUseDropTolerance(pc,dt,dtcol,rowmax).

 
  AO

    

  IS

    
  Draw

  DrawHistxxx  changed to DrawHGxxx

   
  General

 PetsReal() and PetscImaginary() are now PetscRealPart() PetscImaginaryPart()

-optionstable -> -options_table -optionsleft -> -options_left but old left for compatibility

 
  Viewers


  Binary and ASCII viewers can create compressed files by simply appending a .gz on the 
filename.

   PETSc now has a new viewer that generates rudimentary Postscript.
Improvements, additions may be added as needed.
  DrawOpenPS(), or DrawSetType(,DRAW_PS); or -draw_type ps


  SNES 


  DA

    

  TS

   TSSetMonitor() now takes an additional final optional argument that will destroy the
monitor context.
