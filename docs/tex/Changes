  This is list of recent PETSc changes before they are 
transported into the docs/changes.html file. (Because it
is a pain to always check that file out of SourceSafe to 
add to it).

  VEC
    If the option VEC_IGNORE_OFF_PROC_ENTRIES is used the VecAssemblyBegin()
    and End() will not cause any parallel communication or synchronization.

 
   See petsc-maint # 1787 - added  VIEWER_FORMAT_ASCII_INDEX

  MAT

   Added MatSeqAIJSetColumnIndices() and MatSeqBAIJSetColumnIndices().

   If the option MAT_IGNORE_OFF_PROC_ENTRIES is used the MatAssemblyBegin()
    and End() will not cause any parallel communication or synchronization.

   If the option MAT_NO_NEW_NONZERO_LOCATIONS is used, one less collective
   call will be made in the MatAssemblyEnd routines for MPIAIJ and MPIBAIJ.

  KSP

    Added the function KSPSetAvoidNorms() and option -ksp_avoid_norms. For the 
    methods CG, Richardson, Bi-CG-stab, CR, and CGS this eliminates the computation
    of the residual norm at each iteration (which is an expensive, collective 
    operation). Then the convergence criteria depends only on the maximum number
    of iterations you set with KSPSetTolerances(). This is useful when using the 
    Krylov method as a smoother with a fixed, say 3, iterations.
