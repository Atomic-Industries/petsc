  This is list of recent PETSc changes before they are 
transported into the docs/changes.html file. (Because it
is a pain to always check that file out of SourceSafe to 
add to it).

  VEC
    If the option VEC_IGNORE_OFF_PROC_ENTRIES is used the VecAssemblyBegin()
    and End() will not cause any parallel communication or synchronization.

 
   See petsc-maint # 1787 - added  VIEWER_FORMAT_ASCII_INDEX

  MAT

   Added MatSeqAIJSetColumnIndices() and MatSeqBAIJSetColumnIndices().

   If the option MAT_IGNORE_OFF_PROC_ENTRIES is used the MatAssemblyBegin()
    and End() will not cause any parallel communication or synchronization.

   If the option MAT_NO_NEW_NONZERO_LOCATIONS is used, one less collective
   call will be made in the MatAssemblyEnd routines for MPIAIJ and MPIBAIJ.
