  This is list of recent PETSc changes before they are 
transported into the docs/changes.html file. (Because it
is a pain to always check that file out of SourceSafe to 
add to it).

  Add two new PC types PCCOMPOSITE and PCSLES that easily allow building new
PC's by combining two or more preconditioners and allow using any SLES as 
a preconditioner.
