  This is list of recent PETSc changes before they are 
transported into the docs/changes.html file. (Because it
is a pain to always check that file out of SourceSafe to 
add to it).

  VEC


     All VecGetArray() must now be matched with a VecRestoreArray()   

  

  MAT

    Fixed bugs in MatReorderForNonzeroDiagonal() and made it more
    robust.   

   

  KSP

    
    
  PC

    

  AO

    

  IS

    

  General

    Added OptionsGetLogical()

    Changed ViewerFileOpenASCII() to ViewerASCIIOpen()

    Remove the gvec directory from the distribution. If you are using this
 please let us and know and we can provide it or provide alternative code
to do what you need.

  SNES 

    Changed SNESDefaultMatrixFreeMatCreate() to MatSNESFDMFCreate()
    Added 
      MatSNESFDMFSetHHistory(Mat,Scalar *,int);
      MatSNESFDMFResetHHistory(Mat,Scalar *,int);
      MatSNESFDMFSetParameters(Mat,double,double);
      MatSNESFDMFGetH(Mat,Scalar *);
      MatSNESFDMFKSPMonitor(KSP,int,double,void *); and the 
      option -snes_mf_ksp_monitr
    Added support for an alternative way to compute h using the Walker-Pernice
      strategy accessible via -snes_mf_type wp
