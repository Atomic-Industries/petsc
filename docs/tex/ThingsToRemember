Debugging on the Cray t3d:  use totalview:
  With totalview you don't use mpirun; you just run totalview programname. 
  Also when linking to use totalview you must hardwire the number of
  processors, so add -Xnumberprocessors to the link line in the makefile.

PETScView info:
  The initial file for PETScView configuration is petsc/bin/.petscviewrc
  Although we're RCS-ing this file, it must remain checked-out so that
  the owner has write permission.  Otherwise, each new PETScView user
  will be given a default .petscviewrc that is not writable to him.

Nightly build:
  On solaris it is at poplar.math.ucla.edu username bsmith
  On Cray t3d it is at h4p.nersc.gov       username bsmith
     For the t3d we are not allowed to use cron so buildtest 
     uses at to start itself up again 24 hours later.
  The password is in petsc/maint/autoftp
