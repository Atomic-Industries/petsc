PETSc grammar review:
 - Distinction between words "then" and "than"
    - THAN: used in comparisons
       - PETSc is faster THAN, better THAN, more flexible THAN, ...
         all other software in the world :)
    - THEN: used with "if/then" or to indicate time
         If you use PETSc, THEN all your coding worries will be solved ;)
         First preallocate matrix space; THEN assemble the matrix.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever you introduce ANYTHING new in PETSc, be sure to add 
it to the Fortran include files and fix the interface files as
well if necessary; otherwise, indicate that this still needs to be
fixed in the ThingsToDo file.

PETSc Users Mailing list info:
  Perl script for WWW petsc-users subscription is located in:
  charlotte:/www/ncsa_httpd/cgi-bin/petsc/subscribe-to-petsc-users
            (MUST access from charlotte) ... NOT currently used
  To add this to petsc.html, just add hyperlink to petsc-users.html

  petsc-users mailing list password is bsbglmdk

To approve a petsc-users mail in elm use | then approve

General WWW info:
  Steps for making the PETSc picture gif file for petsc.html:
    - draw figure in petscwww.fig and scale appropriately
    - start xv, then grab the region and save as petscwww.gif

  email.html (and charlotte:/www/ncsa_httpd/cgi-bin/petsc/petscmail)
  contains the WWW interface for petsc-maint ... NOT currently used

Converting from Chameleon to MPI:
  See /home/gropp/chameleon/README.  The converter program is
  /home/gropp/tools.n/bin/inlinecomm.

Debugging on the Cray t3d:  use totalview:
  With totalview you don't use mpirun; you just run totalview
  programname. Also when linking to use totalview you must 
  hardwire the number of processors, so add -Xnumberprocessors 
  to the link line in the makefile.

PETScView info:
  The initial file for PETScView configuration is petsc/bin/.petscviewrc
  Although we're RCS-ing this file, it must remain checked-out so that
  the owner has write permission.  Otherwise, each new PETScView user
  will be given a default .petscviewrc that is not writable to him.

  On Cray t3d it is at h4p.nersc.gov       username bsmith

     uses at to start itself up again 24 hours later.

Accounts on NAS machines
For your convenience NAS User Services is available to answer questions
and resolve problems 24 hours each day, 7 days each week.  They can be
reached via telephone at  numbers:(415) 604-4444, FTS 464-4444, (800)

The message of the day (MOTD) is used at NAS to alert you to problems
or system changes to software or hardware.  Please make note of it each
time you log into the systems.

        Welcome to your lovelace(*) account.

        You will notice that a set of initial "dot" files have

To kill the running crontab remove bmake/common and bmake/RCS/common,v


Location of email sent to petsc-maint:
  
  Location of old petsc-maint mail is
  /mcs/adm/request/petsc-maint/[active,resolved]
  it may be processed with /usr/local/req/petsc-maint/bin/petsctkreq
  make sure that /usr/local/req/petsc-maint/bin/ is in your path.

FTP log files:
  /Net/charlotte/logs/ftp/xferlog.XXXX


To determine who is on the PETSc users mailing list send
   to majordom@mcs.anl.gov "who petsc-users"

To unsubscribe a person from petsc-users use
   unsubscribe petsc-users name

To add an object to the PETSc logging:
  - Add object to plog.h, plog.c, petscview, petscview.cfg, plogmpe.c
    ... anything else?

Delete (or "outdate") range of versions from RCS file:
  rcs -o[r1]:[r2] file, where r1 and r2 denote beginning and ending of range
  (e.g., "rcs -o1.1:1.65 matrix.c")

To run parallel jobs using the /tmp/petsc installations: Use, e.g.,
    mpirun -machinefile $PETSC_DIR/maint/hosts.local -np 2 ex1

To encrypt things for the ftp site, on ryan or violet 
run crypt password < file > coded file. To unencrypt do
crypt password < codeedfile > clear file.

Tips for using complex numbers:
     complex x,y(0,0);
     x = complex(1.1,imag(x));       
     x = complex(real(x),2.1);
     x = complex(1.1,2.2);

Approving mail to petsc-users
The easiest way to approve a message is to create a file ~/.majordomo
that contains the lines:

#list         passwd    site
petsc-users   passwd    majordomo@mcs.anl.gov

You could have multiple lines if you control multple lists.  Then
take the message you have and send it through the program "approve".
For MH based mail, that should be "show|approve".  If using "mail", 
you'd have to save the message to a file then "cat file|approve".
For other mailers, you are on your own to determine how to pipe the
message to a program.  Some can do it, and others are like "mail".
