Whenever you introduce ANYTHING new in PETSc, be sure to add 
it to the Fortran include files and fix the interface files as
well if necessary; otherwise, indicate that this still needs to be
fixed in the ThingsToDo file.

PETSc Users Mailing list info:
  Perl script for WWW petsc-users subscription is located in:
  charlotte:/www/ncsa_httpd/cgi-bin/petsc/subscribe-to-petsc-users
            (MUST access from charlotte) ... NOT currently used
  To add this to petsc.html, just add hyperlink to petsc-users.html

  petsc-users mailing list password is bsbglmdk

General WWW info:
  Steps for making the PETSc picture gif file for petsc.html:
    - draw figure in petscwww.fig and scale appropriately
    - start xv, then grab the region and save as petscwww.gif
    - fix petsc/docs/tex/pictures/petsc.map if necessary and
      copy to WWW directory.

  email.html (and charlotte:/www/ncsa_httpd/cgi-bin/petsc/petscmail)
  contains the WWW interface for petsc-maint ... NOT currently used

Converting from Chameleon to MPI:
  See /home/gropp/chameleon/README.  The converter program is
  /home/gropp/tools.n/bin/inlinecomm.

Debugging on the Cray t3d:  use totalview:
  With totalview you don't use mpirun; you just run totalview
  programname. Also when linking to use totalview you must 
  hardwire the number of processors, so add -Xnumberprocessors 
  to the link line in the makefile.

PETScView info:
  The initial file for PETScView configuration is petsc/bin/.petscviewrc
  Although we're RCS-ing this file, it must remain checked-out so that
  the owner has write permission.  Otherwise, each new PETScView user
  will be given a default .petscviewrc that is not writable to him.

ICASE/NASA paragon: crabcake.larc.nasa.gov, account: mcinnes
   See the file ~mcinnes/README on crabcake for up-to-date info on
   the paragon's quirks: 
      - must do "unsetenv TERM" so that make does'nt crash
      - unalias doesn't work
      - must use make -e PETSC_DIR=<whatever>
      - for BlockSolve95 muse use 
            make -e BS_DIR=<whatever> PETSC_DIR=<whatever>
ICASE/NASA SP: poseidon.larc.nasa.gov, account: mcinnes

Paragon account at San Diego
   telnet paragate.sdsc.edu 7577
   user id u12461
   cannot ftp to 
   use /usr/local/bin/rftp to get out, you must use numerical
       IP address with rftp
   you must run make with the -e option and have the environmental
   argument PETSC_DIR properly set.

Nightly build:
  On solaris it is at poplar.math.ucla.edu username bsmith
  On Cray t3d it is at h4p.nersc.gov       username bsmith
     For the t3d we are not allowed to use cron so buildtest 
     uses at to start itself up again 24 hours later.
  The password is in petsc/maint/autoftp
  h4p.nersc.gov name changed to h4p.llnl.gov

ICASE suns:
  ete08-f.icase.ed
  elc02.icase.edu
  dolphin.icase.ed

  A good idea is to look at mpich***/util/machines/machines.sun4 at icase.
  It lists the good sun4s at icase.

SUN ULTRA account:

  See petsc-maint mail from Igor Markov (UCLA) for another account 
     on his home PC running Linux.

To kill the running crontab remove bmake/common and bmake/RCS/common,v


Location of email sent to petsc-maint:
  
  Location of old petsc-maint mail is
  /mcs/adm/request/petsc-maint/[active,resolved]
  it may be processed with /usr/local/req/petsc-maint/bin/petsctkreq
  make sure that /usr/local/req/petsc-maint/bin/ is in your path.

FTP log files:
  login to charlotte.mcs.anl.gov; see files /usr/adm/xferlog.XXXXXXXXX

To determine who is on the PETSc users mailing list send
   to majordom@mcs.anl.gov "who petsc-users"

To unsubscribe a person from petsc-users use
   unsubscribe petsc-users name

To add an object to the PETSc logging:
  - Add object to plog.h, plog.c, petscview, petscview.cfg, plogmpe.c
    ... anything else?

Delete (or "outdate") range of versions from RCS file:
  rcs -o[r1]:[r2] file, where r1 and r2 denote beginning and ending of range
  (e.g., "rcs -o1.1:1.65 matrix.c")

To run parallel jobs using the /tmp/petsc installations: Use, e.g.,
    mpirun -machinefile $PETSC_DIR/maint/hosts.local -np 2 ex1

To encrypt things for the ftp site, on ryan or violet 
run crypt password < file > coded file. To unencrypt do
crypt password < codeedfile > clear file.

Tips for using complex numbers:
     complex x,y(0,0);
     x = complex(1.1,imag(x));       
     x = complex(real(x),2.1);
     x = complex(1.1,2.2);
