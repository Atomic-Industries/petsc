Additional Capabilities that PETSc Needs:

  X - denotes accomplishment!

 o High priorities - should be done before the general release, June 20:

   - Upgrade WWW pages, especially installation information.  Use MPICH 
     format as a model.

   - Upgrade tohtml and doc2tex

   - More nonlinear solvers, including those for unconstrained minimization

   - Build new picture clipper for petsc homepage

   - make HTML summary to be pointed to by map.

   X Build wrapper for html manpages

 o Lower Priority issues:

   - Fortran interface

   - Automatic collection of information about the solution process

   - Finite difference approximations of derivatives using coloring

   - ADIFOR interface

   - make the back issues of PETSc mailing list available from the 
     PETSc homepage. As well as subscribing to the group.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Possible projects for summer students:

 - Develop TK interfaces for options and monitoring 

 - Develop 1 and 3D distributed array code

 - Develop code to rebalance matrices (and vectors) for better 
   load balance during matrix vector multiplies.

 - Use ADIFOR with ACTI codes.  Help incorporate ADIFOR interface 
   into PETSc.  

 - Develop additional test problems:
    - Develop utilities to create common matrices and vectors (for testing
      SLES, to serve as templates, and to fulfill basic needs).  
      See  /home/gropp/tools.n/solvers/examples/formsol.c and
      /home/gropp/tools.n/fd/* for ideas.
    - Convert more MINPACK-2 example problems to the PETSc coding style
    - Consider CUTE test suite

 - Interface to ScaLAPACK and BLACS

 - Complex versions of the Krylov subspace solvers

 - 1d wave equation, heat equation, etc examples with seperate graphics 
   for each processor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes that should be made to PETSc 
  - massive changes that require access to all files or changes that 
    break the structures
