  Make log summary print name of exceutable it is rujnning!!!!!!@

Additional Capabilities that PETSc Needs:

  X - denotes accomplishment!
  * - denotes work in progress

 -------------------
 o High priorities:
 -------------------

   To do BEFORE the next release:
  --------------------------------

  - Add new DA routine to extract more general processor subsets
    (e.g., subblocks).  More general?

  - Provide a VecGetArray_Quick() for the matrix computational kernels
    and VecRestoreArray_Quick() <- Null macro. This is to save eight function 
    calls for every MatMult() etc. May not be noticable but can't do any harm.

  - make ViewerPushFormat() ViewerPopFormat() use that to eliminate
    saving of formats in for example MatCreate().

  - ILUDT()

  - ordering with flow direction.

  - Better way of dealing with MatAssembly - when elements are not inserted
    (satish)

  * reorganize nightly builds, using /home/MPI/mpich/maint/runlist
    as an example.

  - add Flexible GMRES routine

  - cool example using KELP

  - HPF interface

  - interface to Tom Coleman's post-docs Cholesky code.

  - Change PCSetUp_BJacobiAIJ() to use MatGetSubMatrices() rather then 
    MatGetSubMatrix() since someone decided MatGetSubMatrix cannot 
    be logged so MPIAIJ format with bjacobi is completely worthless 
    cause we don't have a clue as to how much time is spent getting 
    submatrices.

  - Fix MPIRowbs so factorization routiens return NEW matrix, NOT the 
    original matrix. Then fix MatMult() etc to make sure one does not
    multiply a factored matrix!!!!!!!!!!!!

  - Create an INDEX for examples


  * Provide routine for initializeing Fortran side of PETSc when 
    main program is C. i.e. this sets common blocks and PETSC_NULL_Fortran

 (Barry)  - Have all preconditioners (including LU) support null space, see 
            tools.n/solvers/nullsp.c petsc/src/pc/interface/pcnull.c

 (Bill)   - Make configure fully functional in PETSc 2.0

  - Chapter in users manual on how PETSc would be used with 
    different types of grid problems. Or different document.

  - Make sure all Fortran examples run for complex on all machines, note
    this means the bmake files must insure that -DPETSC_COMPLEX is 
    properly set.


  - Do something about viewer formats - maybe use enum?
    Make ViewerGetFormat() a real public routine (seems good to me); else
    make it obviously private.

  * Test PETSc with LAM.
    
  - Fix binary I/O for complex numbers.

  - Fix GMRESCycle() so that test for "happy breakdown" is actually
    used.  See petsc-maint message #282 from David.

  X Note fixes needed for ICASE SP (poseidon) in petsc/src/sys/src/mtr.c
    and petsc/src/viewer/impls/matlab/send.c

  X Take mention of BLACS and Scalapack from PETSc picture.

  X find LAgesvd_ on Cray T3D. Not supported by libsci.a, therefore
    we generate an error and exit.

  X Fix BDiag factorization to use Barry's new Linpack-modified stuff.
    Also change to actually invert diagonal blocks rather then keeping 
    triangular factors and doing triangular solves on the blocks in 
    each backsolve. As is done in SeqBAIJ.

  X For MatLoad() add support for automatically checking for file 
    filename.info that contains additional information on matrix in 
    unformated ascii. For example blocksize 5 and diagonals

  X Provide etags rule in makefile for public releases (no inclusion of
    *.tex files, etc.)

  X Fix the F*&^ bug that PETSc does not work on Cray T3d with two 
    processors bjacobi preconditioner with ILU(0) on subdomains!!!!!!!!
    For example, arco1

  X fix rules on all machines that do .F files, so they work properly 
    with PETSC_COMPLEX but don't generate warnign messages like
    cpp -I../../.. -I../../../include -I/usr/local/mpi/include  
    -I../../../src -O -D
    PETSC_DEBUG -DPETSC_BOPT_O  somefort.F  > somefort.f
    cpp: Invalid option `-O'
    gmake[1]: [../../../lib/libO_complex/freebsd_nolog/libpetscfortran
    .a(somefort.o)
    ] Error 33 (ignored)
    f77 -c  -O somefort.f

  X Fix F.o rules to pass proper flags; i.e. yes -I flags but maybe not
    -O flags on some machines, for example paragon.
  X fix output formats for -log_summary so that 3-digit numbers (e.g., 100.0) 
    doesn't screw up column alignment

  X update petscopts ( some of the options are outdated  for eg: pc_method )

  X extend PETSc PLogInfo() logging so that individual components can disable
    their printouts (e.g., get SNES logging but not matrix logging)

  X Debugger info? fixed. 

  X Fortran doesn't read aliases from .petscrc

  X Section on ASM in users manual.

  X Make a SNESMonitor() like the KSPMonitor() in kspimpl.h and 
    insure that it is sued everywhere instead of calls to (*snes->monitor)

  X Make -snes_xmonitor stash the DrawLG in SNES and then have it 
    destroyed in SNESDestroy(), like as is done for KSP.


  X Make a -ksp monitor that displays residual and true residual, like 
    the -ksp_bsmonitor. Added -ksp_truemonitor and -ksp_xtruemonitor

  X Test MATMPIROWBS for nonsymmetric matrices by building another 
    set of ARCO matrices by removing small values from them.

  X Change Scalabe ODE solvers to Scalable Time-Steppers

  X Allow users to pass petsc objects between Fortran and C.

  X add filename to petscinitialize for fortran

  X Fix PetscRandomCreate() so that it actually generates random numbers
    for all machines.

  X Fix PetscGetArchType() for Fortran.

  X Make MatGetArray_MPIDense().

  X rs6000_p4 machines:  Fortran programs don't print output when stdout
    is directed to a file (e.g., failure of sles/examples/ex7.F to
    print KSP residual norms in runex7).  Fix this.

  X Performance file: Elaborate on reuse of vectors, et by employing user
    context, use SNES examples for illustrations.

  X Fix PetscView demo log file to work with new profile format.
    Cleanup PetscView.

  X Add parallel viewer for MPIROWBS matrix format.

  X Add inode info to MatView() with info format.

  X Remove default stuff from MatCreate() into each matrix type, including
    processing command line options.

  X But in jump links for WWW manpages seealso.
   X Fix documentation for matrices in manual (also AIJ man pages).  
     Fix help info for matrices. MatPrintHelp().

   X Fix MPIRowbs format so that one can INSERT_VALUES with nonsymmetric matrix.

   X Make MatGetSubMatrices() for Seq and MPI AIJ.

   X Make MatIncreaseOverlap() for Seq and MPI AIJ.

   X Do overlapping additive Schwarz for Seq and MPI AIJ.

   X Fix SNES so that the right-hand-side of the Newton systems is not
     ever scaled by -1.0, but instead this is taken care of in the
     update step, x += alpha * dx   OR   x -= alpha * dx.

   X Complex versions of the Krylov subspace solvers

   X Complex version work from Fortran

   X Have -log_summary print percentages for different stages.

   X don't require user to set diagonal entries in mpirowbs, that is
     insane - says Barry.
   
   X But BlockSolve _requires_ a diagonal entry for each row, even if it is
     zero - says Lois.
     I have changed the MatCreateMPIRowbs() to create an initial matrix that 
     already has zeros on the diagonal so that the user need not set them

   X Allow column and row oriented input for MatSetValues() for all matrix types,

   X Increase user-definable events (needed by Tom Canfield).  Maybe now's
     the time to expand base PETSc events as well?

   X Parallel vector to parallel vector scatter.

   X Fix KSPSetGMRESxxx routines:  possibly zap 
     KSPGMRESSetUseUnmodifiedGramSchmidt() in favor of just
     KSPGMRESSetOrthogRoutine().

   X Make symbolic part of ILU(0) out of place fast for SeqAIJ. Just copy data 
     structures.

   X Change all CAPS macro to use _ between words, for example INSERT_VALUES

   X Add flag where user can announce that matrix is structurally symmetric and 
     that they are inserting all values for MPIRowbs, this prevents unneeded 
     communication.

From: Jussi Maki <Jussi.Maki@csc.fi>
To: rs2hpm@csc.fi
Subject: rs2hpm list and sources available

Howdy folks,

I finally got the permission from IBM Austin to distribute the source
code on rs2hpm (on 15th May 1996 Ed Welbon IBM/Austin stated:
"Jussi, You may release your source code for the SP2 performance
monitor at your disgression. ... As in the past, we can commit no
support for the monitor. ")

I have now created the rs2hpm@csc.fi mailing list on the SP2 and
POWER2 hardware performance monitor subject. Please use it for
discussion and on distributing new ideas. I hope you don't mind but I
added all you who have contacted me on the rs2hpm subject to the list.

The source code version is now available at
http://www.csc.fi/~jmaki/rs2hpm-dist/960605/rs2hpm-2.0-960605-src.tar.Z
This latest version fixes some bugs including wrong sampling
collection of data cache counters (my apologies on that).

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  - MatSetBlockValues()

  - Right and left preconditioning for all KSP types.

   - Augment some KSP methods to support symmetric preconditioning; fix relevant
     KSP support routines.

  ? Make jacobi and SOR be seperate for each matrix type. So then 
    have default use natural block size and support option 
    -pc_jacobi_pointwise etc.

  - Add diagnotics for memory allocation using PLogInfo (like already done 
    for AIJ format) for Rowbs and BDiag formats.

  - Fix PCView() for ASM, block Jacobi, block GS so that parallel case
    is not just jumbled output.  If using same solvers on all blocks, print
    subSLES info once?  Or maybe better - collect info that differs among
    blocks/procs (such as LU nonzeros) and then print only from 1 proc.


  - Add routine for forming big matrix from a bunch of smaller ones, something 
       like:
        MatSetSubmatrix(Mat large,Mat small,int *rows, int *cols)

  - Write uniprocessor ICC code; possibly also introduce symmetric storage variant.

  - Treat interleaved vector as seperate named vectors

   - Provide MPIU_MAXSUM and use it to replace use of MAT_SUM + MAT_MAX everywhere.

   - Add matrix viewers to show element magnitude by coloring (requested by
      Andreas).

   - Add viewer for matrix graph - possibly interface to external software?
     (requested by Andreas) 

   - Allow one to view a reordered matrix, perhaps 
       by providing a MatReOrder(Mat,IS,IS,Mat*)?

   ? Reorganize multigrid code. (requested by Andreas).

   - Maybe add a routine VecCreateVecs()?  Seems useful to me instead of having
     to create a base vector, then duplicate it.

   ? Add copyright info to header of each file?  See, e.g., MPICH.

   - Examine the SPEC benchmarks to verify that we're using the appropriate
     compiler options for optimized code.  For info:  http://www.specbench.org

   - Aim for more exhaustive PETSc testing.  From 
        /home/MPI/mpich/examples/test/rlist.srt:
        # This is a list of MPI usages in the test programs, generated with 
        # strings */*.c | grep MPI | tr -cs 'A-Za-z_' '\012' | grep MPI | sort |
           uniq
        # This can be used, in comparison with the routine index, to find routines
        # still needing tests.


   - Make VecScatterCopy_  for the different types of scatters and use 
     a uniform naming scheme.

   - MatExpand() and VecExpand() talk to Paul about how this is done in SUMMA.

   - Make PLogFlops() also log loads and stores.


 (Satish)   * Add functionality to bjacobi to support block Gauss-Seidel including 
              support for coloring in parallel.

   * Develop basic PETSc benchmark suite

   - Develop additional test problems:
      - Develop utilities to create common matrices and vectors (for testing
        SLES, to serve as templates, and to fulfill basic needs).  
        See  /home/gropp/tools.n/solvers/examples/formsol.c and
        /home/gropp/tools.n/fd/* for ideas.
      - Convert more MINPACK-2 example problems to the PETSc coding style
      - Consider CUTE test suite

   - Redo parts of inline for basic operations and improved performance.
     Associated with MISF.

 (Lois)   * Parallel dense matrix implementation.

   * Block compressed row storage format implementation.

   - Introduce a concept of Vecs and provide multiple right hand side
     versions of MatMult.... Then do KSP versions.

   - Incorporate SPARSKIT strategy of Saad for managing AIJ data structure.
     (requested by Xiao Chuan Cai; this is supposedly much faster than
     our current code).

   * Improve history (-log_history) logging.

  X Add provision so that all -info printouts indicate the associated
    processor.  In particular, storage allocation of submatrices for MATMPIAIJ:
      MatAssemblyEnd_SeqAIJ:Unneeded storage space 351 used 609 rows 60
    What processor is this coming from?

   X Add nonsymmetric matrix reorderings for use in LU (requested by Andreas)

   X When one is using a MatShell it would be nice if PC knew to use no
     preconditioning when no special preconditioner is applied. This would 
     prevent the annouying error message about MatGetDiagonal() when it 
     tries to use the default jacobi preconditioner.

   X Add error checking in SLESSolve(), MatMult(), PCApply(), etc. for the case 
     when input vector == output vector.

   X In-place ILU(0) for AIJ (Done), Row matrix formats (not done, should we?)

   X More nonlinear solvers, including those for unconstrained minimization

   X Make PETSc work using include/mpiuni.h (i.e. no MPI needed)

   X Make it possible to zoom in on viewed matrices.

   X Add iterative refinement or some similar technique to Unmodified Gram-Schmidt
     code to cheaply stablize.

   X Change mytid and numtid(s) throughout code to rank and size to match MPI terms.

   X Upgrade WWW pages, especially installation information.  Use MPICH 
     format as a model.

   X Build new picture clipper for petsc homepage

   X make HTML summary to be pointed to by map.

   X Build wrapper for html manpages


 -------------------------
 o Lower Priority issues:
 -------------------------

   - Finite difference approximations of derivatives using coloring

   - Implement nested factorization preconditioner?

   - Add matrix reduction plus ILU preconditioner. 

   - stride with multicomponent chunks in index sets, also two dimensional
     and three dimensional chunks

   * Develop code to rebalance matrices (and vectors) for better 
     load balance during matrix vector multiplies.

   NO Interface to ScaLAPACK and BLACS

   X Automatic collection of information about the solution process

   X Fortran interface

   X 1d wave equation, heat equation, etc examples with seperate graphics 
      for each processor.
 
   X Develop TK interfaces for options and monitoring 

   X Develop 1 and 3D distributed array code



   Features for TOHTML
   ------------------


   * Fix fact that first line of verbatim in html files have all leading blanks
     removed. (Note our makefile puts in three blanks before ierr which fixes
     90 percent of the problems for manual.html)
    (The verbatim handler for tothml seems not to put a carriage return 
     after the <pre><tt> and before the text. This causes the first line 
     of verbatim text to be printed incorrectly. I think this can be fixed
     by simply putting a \n after the outputed <pre><tt>)

   - allow inputed example files to have PETSc routine names mapped to manpages.

    doesn't handle \& correctly as a & in regular text.

    tothml doesn't handle \cite{} with -mapref../www/petsc.cit
    when the \cite is within an included file. 

    \ge doesn't seem to work correctly

    Also the automatic manpage finder feature invoked by -mapman does not
    seem to be able to handle function names with integers in them like
    DACreate2d()

    In the enumerate environment tothml doesn't seem to be able to handle
   \subitem and \subsubitem. It also seems to put to much blank space
    before and after the enumerate list. 

   An additional feature that would be great for tohtml, especially in
   handling large documents (such as the ever expanding PETSc users
   manual), is the optional addition of buttons for "Contents" and
   "Index" with the usual "up", "next", "previous" buttons.  

   Make \begin{tabular} environments look better. 

   X reorganize format of manpages (both Unix and HTML) to display synopsis 
     before keywords and seealso.
