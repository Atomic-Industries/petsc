Additional Capabilities that PETSc Needs:

  X - denotes accomplishment!
  * - denotes work in progress

 -------------------
 o High priorities:
 -------------------

   To do BEFORE the next release:
  --------------------------------

   - Make configure fully functional in PETSc 2.0

   - Fix documentation for matrices in manual (also AIJ man pages).  
     Fix help info for matrices.

   - Design better ILU/ICC interface for mpirowbs format (so that PC 
     selection is correct and symmetric matrix can use ILU). Cannot do.

   - Fix bug in MatCreateMPIAIJ() for rectangular matrices (not square)

   - Fix bug in MatTranspose_AIJ for rectangular matrices.

   - Fix MPIRowbs format so that one can INSERT_VALUES with nonsymmetric matrix.

   - Implement MatDisAssemble() for all parallel matrix types.
    
   X Fix KSPSetGMRESxxx routines:  possibly zap 
     KSPGMRESSetUseUnmodifiedGramSchmidt() in favor of just
     KSPGMRESSetOrthogRoutine().

   X Make symbolic part of ILU(0) out of place fast for SeqAIJ. Just copy data structures.

   X Change all CAPS macro to use _ between words, for example INSERT_VALUES

   X Add flag where user can announce that matrix is structurally symmetric and 
     that they are inserting all values for MPIRowbs, this prevents unneeded 
     communication.


   To do sometime soon:
  ----------------------

   - Develop basic PETSc benchmark suite

   - Redue parts of inline for basic operations and improved performance.
     Associated with MISF.

   - Make PETSc work using include/mpiuni.h (i.e. no MPI needed)

   - Parallel dense matrix implementation.

   - Block compressed row storage format implementation.

   - Introduce a concept of Vecs and provide multiple right hand side
     versions of MatMult.... Then do KSP versions.

   - Incorporate SPARSKIT strategy of Saad for managing AIJ data structure.
     (requested by Xiao Chuan Cai; this is supposedly much faster than
     our current code).

   - Develop more thorough test program suite.

   - Complex versions of the Krylov subspace solvers

   - Make it possible to zoom in on viewed matrices.

   - Make special MatLUFactorNumeric_SeqAIJ() for identity permutation.

   * Improve history (-log_history) logging.

   * In-place ILU(0) for AIJ (Done), Row matrix formats (not done, should we?)

   * Upgrade tohtml and doc2tex

   * More nonlinear solvers, including those for unconstrained minimization

   X Add iterative refinement or some similar technique to Unmodified Gram-Schmidt
     code to cheaply stablize.

   X Change mytid and numtid(s) throughout code to rank and size to match MPI terms.

   X Upgrade WWW pages, especially installation information.  Use MPICH 
     format as a model.

   X Build new picture clipper for petsc homepage

   X make HTML summary to be pointed to by map.

   X Build wrapper for html manpages


 -------------------------
 o Lower Priority issues:
 -------------------------

   - Finite difference approximations of derivatives using coloring

   - ADIFOR interface

   - make the back issues of PETSc mailing list available from the 
     PETSc homepage. As well as subscribing to the group.

   - stride with multicomponent chunks in index sets, also two dimensional
     and three dimensional chunks

   * Automatic collection of information about the solution process

   X Fortran interface

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Possible projects for students:

 - Develop code to rebalance matrices (and vectors) for better 
   load balance during matrix vector multiplies.

 - Use ADIFOR with ACTI codes.  Help incorporate ADIFOR interface into PETSc.  

 - Develop additional test problems:
    - Develop utilities to create common matrices and vectors (for testing
      SLES, to serve as templates, and to fulfill basic needs).  
      See  /home/gropp/tools.n/solvers/examples/formsol.c and
      /home/gropp/tools.n/fd/* for ideas.
    - Convert more MINPACK-2 example problems to the PETSc coding style
    - Consider CUTE test suite

 - Interface to ScaLAPACK and BLACS

 X 1d wave equation, heat equation, etc examples with seperate graphics 
   for each processor.

 X Develop TK interfaces for options and monitoring 

 X Develop 1 and 3D distributed array code
