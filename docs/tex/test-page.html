<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
 The goal of this project, funded out of DOE's Advanced Computing
Technology Initiative (ACTI), is the development of a Next-Generation
Oil Reservoir Simulator using the latest software, computers,
algorithms, and simulation technology.  This project is joint with the
<A href="http://www.pe.utexas.edu/"> Center for Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering</a> and the <A href="http://www.ticam.utexas.edu/Groups/SubSurfMod/"> Center for
Subsurface Modeling</a> at the University of Texas at Austin. See <A
href="http://www.pe.utexas.edu/HPCC/papers_projects/new_gen.htmll">
the project's home page</a> for a broader description of the project
and current activities.  <P>

technology.

<H3>Specific Accomplishments</H3>
<P>
The project was officially launched in July 1995. Through August 1996, 
the following Argonne contributions have been made.

<MENU>
<LI>
enhanced our
computational differentiation
software tools---a critical step for
sensitivity analysis,
design,
and optimization of complex systems, and
<LI>
revised our parallel nonlinear solvers to provide needed support
for black oil models
<LI>designed and implemented efficient, practical, and 
    scalable preconditioners for linear solvers, including two main 
    families, based on
  <MENU>
  <LI>global (i.e. parallel) incomplete factorization (ILU and ICC) 
      preconditioners, and
  <LI>overlapping subdomain based preconditioners (i.e. Schwarz
      domain decomposition)
  </MENU>
<LI>incorporated coding strategies to obtain the best efficiency
    for each algorithm by taking advantage of computer memory hierarchies, both
  <MENU>
  <LI>    internally on a processor by using the cache efficiently, (e.g.
           loop unrolling and using blocked data structures), and
  <LI>    among processors by overlapping communication among
           processors and computation on the processors
  </MENU>
<LI> began to develop flexible code for the time evolution of discrete PDE problems.
