  PETSc users,

    We're thinking of setting up a section of the PETSc homepage
that points to PETSc user's homepages related to their projects that
use PETSc. If you are interested in having your project's homepage
represented, please let us know by sending email to petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov . 
You can help us by sending the HTML to include; an example is

  The <A HREF="http://www.myu.edu/projects/neat.html">NeAT Library</A>
  developed by <A HREF="http://www.myu.edu/home/doe">John Doe</A> solves 
  unified field equations with PETSc.

This lists the home page of the project and the author, and gives a one-line
description of what it is.  

  The PETSc Team,

  Satish, Bill, Lois, and Barry
