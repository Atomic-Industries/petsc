PETSc users,

We're thinking of creating a section of the PETSc homepage,
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc.html, that points to PETSc users'
homepages related to their projects that use PETSc. If you are
interested in having your project's homepage represented, please let
us know by sending email to petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov .  You can help us
by sending the HTML to include; an example is

  The <A HREF="http://www.myu.edu/projects/neat.html">NeAT Library</A>
  developed by <A HREF="http://www.myu.edu/home/doe">John Doe</A> solves 
  unified field equations with PETSc.

This lists the home page of the project and the author, and provides a
one-line project description.

We are planning to add this section to the PETSc homepage at the
time of our next release, expected in mid-January. 

The PETSc Team,
Satish, Bill, Lois, and Barry
