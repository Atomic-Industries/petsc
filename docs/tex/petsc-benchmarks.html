These benchmarks are provided to give PETSc users (and potential users) an indication 
of the type of performance they may expect from their tuned applications. They are
in no way "official" and should not form the basis of purchasing decisions; further 
tuning on particular machines could introduced potentially large changes in the 
floating point rates. We urge anyone with tuning suggestions to contact us at
petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov.

We present two types of benchmarks:

<MENU>
<LI> <b>total application code performance</b>, including parallel speedup on a variety of
                                         systems, and
<LI> <a href="petsc-benchmarks.html#ComputationalKernels">computational kernel performance</a>, 
                                           floating point rates for basic operations
                                         (sparse matrix vector products, triangular solves, etc)
                                         <b>as measured in a complete running application code</b>.

<A NAME="ApplicationCode"> <H1 align=center>Application Code</H1> </A>

<MENU>
<LI> A prototypical CFD calculation on a three dimensional unstructured grid.
<LI> Vertex centered control volume approach.
<LI> Incompressible Euler discretized using a 2nd order Roe scheme.
<LI> Based in the FUN3d code of Kyle Anderson (NASA Langeley).
<LI> Steady state computed using pseudo-transient continuation; 
<LI> A matrix free Newton approach is used to solve the non-linear system, while 
     a preconditioner matrix is generated explicitly from a first order approximation of
     the PDE.
  <MENU>
   <LI> each nonlinear solve is approximately computed with one Newton step.
   <LI> each linear solve is approximately computed with 10 iterations of preconditioned
        GMRES 
   <LI> the preconditioner is either block Jacobi or ASM with ILU(0) in-place solver 
        on each block.
