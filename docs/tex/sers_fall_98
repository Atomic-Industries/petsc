The solution of large-scale partial differential equations arises in
the numerical modeling of a wide range scientific applications.
PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation
(http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc) is an object oriented library for the
solution of such systems.  The software runs under UNIX (including the
Cray T3E, SGI Origin2000, and Linux) as well as Windows 9X/NT and is
currently installed at over two hundred user sites around the world.
Our small team designs, develops, and maintains the software.

We invite Stephen Moser to join our group for the fall semester.  His
contributions would include
  - developing specific parallel PDE solvers using the PETSc
    infrastructure, and
  - developing Java applets that allow running these applications 
    over the web.
This project will contribute to the development of a numerical
laboratory that enables easy running of parallel numerical experiments
in fluids and other physical phenomena modeled by partial differential
equations.

The MCS Division of Argonne National Laboratory has an 80-node IBM SP,
a PC cluster running Linux, a 96-node SGI Origin2000, as well as two
smaller SGI machines with InfiniteReality graphics engines. In
addition, we have access to a 512-node Cray T3E.
