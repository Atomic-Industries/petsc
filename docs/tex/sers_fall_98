   The PETSc (Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation)
team in the Mathematics and Computer Science Division (MCS) at Argonne
National Laboratory develops parallel software for the solution of
partial differential equations (PDEs). The software runs under Unix,
including the Cray T3E, SGI Origin2000, linux, as well as Windows
9X/NT.  We currently have over two hundred user sites around the
world. Our small team designs, develops and maintains the software.
More information on PETSc can be obtained at http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc.
Another related project is the ALICE memory snooper that allows one to 
monitor and steer a running application.

  We would like to invite Stephen Moser to join our team for the fall 
semester. His contributions would include
* developing specific parallel PDE solvers using the PETSc infrastructure
* developing JAVA applets that allow running these applications over the web,

This would result in the development of a numerical laboratory that allows 
for the easy running of "numerical" experiments in fluids and other physical
phenomena modeled by PDEs.

 The MCS division has an 80 node IBM SP, a PC cluster running Linux, a
96 node SGI Origin, as well as two smaller SGI machines with InfinityReality
graphics engines. In addition, we have access to a 512 node Cray T3E.
