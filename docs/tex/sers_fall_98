   The PETSc (Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation) team at
Argonne National Laboratory develops parallel software for the solution of
partial differential equations (PDEs). The software runs under Unix, including 
the SGI Origin parallel computers, Cray T3E, linux, as well as Windows 9X/NT. 
We currently have over two hundred user sites around the world. Our small team
designs, develops and maintains the software. More information on PETSc can
be obtained at http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc.

  We would like to invite Stephen Moser to join our team for the fall semester
Part of his work would involve:
*  developing specific parallel PDE solvers using the PETSc infrastructure
* developing JAVA applets that allow running these applications over the web

This would result in the development of a numerical laboratory that allows 
for the easy running of "numerical" experiments in fluids and other physical
phenomana modeled by PDEs.
