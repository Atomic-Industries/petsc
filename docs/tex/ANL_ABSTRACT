4.   BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  Briefly describe the purposes of the computer program, state the
     problem being solved, and summarize the program functions and capabilities.  This will
     be the primary field used for announcement purposes.

       A software toolkit for the parallel, numerical solution of partial differential
     equations and minimization problems. Includes software for the solution of linear and
     nonlinear systems of equations. 

5.   METHOD OF SOLUTION:  Provide a short summary of the mathematical methods,
     engineering principles, numerical algorithms, and procedures incorporated into the
     software.

       Kyrlov space methods, Newton methods, multigrid methods, domain decomposition methods,
     classical iterative methods such as SOR. 

6.   PLATFORMS:  List the computer(s) on which this submittal package will run.

       Unix workstations including: Sun Sparcstations, IBM rs6000, SGI, 
       Parallel processor machines including: IBM SP, Intel Paragon, 

7.   OPERATING SYSTEM:  Indicate the operating system used, release number, and any
     deviations or exceptions, i.e. is the operating system "off the shelf" with no
     modifications, or has the operating system been modified or customized.  If modified,
     note modifications in RELATED AND AUXILIARY SOFTWARE, below.

      Unix without operating system modifications.

8.   IMPLEMENTATION LANGUAGE(S):  Indicate the programming language(s) in which the
     software is written along with the approximate percentage (in parentheses) of each
     used.  For example, FORTRAN IV (95%); Assembler (5%).

      C (90%), C++ (5%), Fortran 77 (5%).

9.   SOFTWARE LIMITATIONS:  Provide a short paragraph on any restrictions implied by
     storage allocation, such as the maximum number of energy groups and mesh points,
     as well as those due to approximations used, such as implied argument-range
     limitations.  Also to be used to indicate the maximum number of users, etc. or other
     limitations.

       Limitations are all hardware dependent. No software dependent time or space 
     limitations.

10.  UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE SOFTWARE:  Highlight the advantages, distinguishing
     features, or other special capabilities which may influence the user to select this
     package over a number of similar packages.

       Flexibility, extensible, portable.

11.  RELATED AND AUXILIARY SOFTWARE:  If the software supersedes or is an extension
     of earlier software, identify the original software here.  Identify any programs not
     considered an integral part of this software but used in conjunction with it (e.g. for
     preparing input data, plotting results, or coupled through use of external data files). 
     Note similar library software, when known.

     Auxiliary software: MPICH, Blocksolve, Lapack, BLAS.

12.  OTHER PROGRAMMING OR OPERATING INFORMATION OR RESTRICTIONS:  Indicate
     file naming conventions used, e.g., (filename).DOC (DOC is a filename extension
     normally used to indicate a documentation file), additional subroutines, function
     libraries, installation support software, or any special routines required for operation of
     this package other than the operating system and programming language requirements
     listed in other fields.  If proprietary software is required, this should be indicated.

     My be used with IBM proprietary software package ESSL, but this is not required.


13.  HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:  List hardware and installation environment requirements
     necessary for full utilization of the software.  Include memory and RAM requirements,
     in addition to any nonstandard features.

     Minimum of eight megabytes of RAM and thirty-two megabytes of disk storage recommended.

14.  TIME REQUIREMENTS:  Include any time requirements, both wall clock and computer
     clock, necessary for execution of the package.  Give enough detail to enable the
     potential user to estimate the execution time for a given choice of program parameters
     (e.g. 5-10 min.). 

     Time is machine and problem dependent, anywhere from one second to one week.

15.  REFERENCES:  List citations of pertinent publications.  List (by author, title, report
     number, bar code or order number if available and date).  References are to be broken
     down into two groupings: 
 
          a.   Reference documents that are provided with the submittal package.

               Cool WWW documentation.
    
          b.   Any additional background reference materials generally available.
