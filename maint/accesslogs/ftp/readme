  This directory contains a list of the PETSc ftp retreivels and 
code to generate the list and plot retreivals as a function of 
time in Matlab.

  find_petsc - searches through the ftp logs and generates a list of
the petsc retrievals

  ftpcheck - counts the retrievels in the file generated by find_petsc,
removing duplicates and ones that the PETSc team got.

  petsc_year_one_retrievals - list of retrievals in first year.
  petsc_year_one_retrievals.ps - plot of retrievals in first year.

  petsc_ftp_retrivials_to_?? - list of retrievals from Day 1 until the 
given ?? date.

  The ftp log files are on charlotte.mcs.anl.gov in 
/usr/adm/xferlog.XXXXXXXXX (note that they are put into a new file
about once a week) The latest ones for the last few days are always in
/usr/adm/xferlog.

  When appending to petsc_ftp_retrivials_to_?? NEVER add those from the 
 /usr/adm/xferlog file otherwise you will screw up the master listing.
Instead put all the weekly lists together at the end of 
petsc_ftp_retrivials_to_?? and then make a tempoerary copy of that 
and append the entries from the incomplete /usr/adm/xferlog to that.
From that file run ftpcheck. Then when done destroy that temperary file.
