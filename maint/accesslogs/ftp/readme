  This directory contains a list of the PETSc ftp retreivels and 
code to generate the list and plot retreivals as a function of 
time in Matlab.

  find_petsc - searches through the ftp logs and generates a list of
the petsc retrievals

  ftpcheck - counts the retrievels in the file generated by find_petsc,
removing duplicates and ones that the PETSc team got.

  petsc_year_one_retrievals - list of retrievals in first year.
  petsc_year_one_retrievals.ps - plot of retrievals in first year.

  petsc_ftp_retrivials_to_?? - list of retrievals from Day 1 until the 
given ?? date.

  The ftp log files are in /nfs/logs/ftp



  Using the Matlab command
f = polyfit(time,y(:,2)) after reomving the first 20 values from
y generates the quadratic y = .0015 x^2 + 1.2596 x + 107.15 
which very closly matches the graph. This means the number of 
retreivals per day grows linearly with 
per day = .003 x + 1.2596
all kind of disappointing; after 10 years we will only have 24,000
total retreivals. Oh well, April 20, 1998. Barry
