This file contains a list of the special definitions needed by PETSc, 
along with a brief description (including the system where the need was
discovered).

   USES_FORTRAN_SINGLE - for machines where Fortran single precision is
                         64 bits. For Cray T3D. Used in 
                         include/pinclude/plapack.h

   USES_CPTOFCD - Fortran charactor strings are passed using a FCD pointer.
                  For Cray T3D. Used in plapack.h fortran/custom/*

   HAVE_GETDOMAINNAME - the system routine getdomainname exits. Found on 
                        all machines except Cray T3d.

   HAVE_FORTRAN_UNDERSCORE_UNDERSCORE - Fortran compiler appends __ for 
                        and routine name that has an _ in it. This happens
                        on Linux and Freebsd using f2c.

   USES_VOID_VOID_VOID_VOID_TSEARCH - rs6000 (older), hpux, IRIX, and IRIX64

   USES_VOID_VOID_CONST_VOID_CONST_VOID_TSEARCH - Prototyping for the 
        arguments in the tsearch routine. Solaris and later versions of 
        AIX, (4.1 for example).
